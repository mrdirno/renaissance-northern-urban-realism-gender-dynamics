## **Chapter 1**

Cloth, not coin, was the currency of this marriage. Margriet’s fingers, chapped from lye, traced the weave of her husband’s new doublet—fine Flemish wool, dyed madder-red with her savings. From the street below, the guildsmen’s laughter was a blunt instrument. She counted each thread in the selvedge, her arithmetic of silence.



The warmth inside was a physical blow, thick with the smell of stale beer, brine, and the underlying tang of bodies that had worked all day. Conversation, a low, guttural murmur in the local dialect, hit a lull as heads turned. Not many women came in here alone, not at this hour, not looking like I did: a stray cat dragged through a puddle. I met the glances, held them for a beat too long until they slid away. A show of teeth, however subtle, was the only currency they understood in here.

“Els.” Jan, the owner, a man built like a barrel with a beard to match, nodded from behind the zinc counter. He didn’t smile. He just pushed a chipped tumbler of *jenever* across the wood, the clear liquid catching the weak, yellow light of the overhead lamp. Payment expected later, in coin or in kind. Usually coin, in my case. Usually.

I took the glass, my fingers stiff and red, and found my spot in the corner, my back to the wall. The gin burned a clean, medicinal path to my stomach, a small hearth lit inside. From here, I could see the whole room: the old men playing a silent, grim game of cards; the dockworkers with forearms like cured hams, their laughter too loud; the two men in better coats, city clerks maybe, hunched over a whispered conversation. And him. Pieter.

He was at his usual table, near the stove. A draftsman for the shipyards, he called himself. An artist. His hands were stained with ink, not tar, long-fingered and restless. He was sketching on a napkin, head down, a lock of dark hair falling over his brow. He hadn’t seen me come in. Good. I liked to watch him unobserved, to see the slight frown of concentration, the way he’d chew his lower lip. He was too fine for this place, too fine for me, a fact he seemed blissfully, stupidly unaware of.

I was halfway through the second gin, bought this time with the last of my coins, when the door banged open again. The wind rushed in, carrying a spray of rain and three men. They weren’t regulars. You could tell by the cut of their clothes—not rich, but trying to be—and by the way they stood, scanning the room like they were buying cattle. Mercantile types from the South, maybe. Speculators. Leeches.

They took a table, ordered beer, and their voices rose above the room’s murmur. Talk of tariffs, of grain shipments from the Baltic, of profit margins. One of them, a florid man with a gold ring on his pinky, held forth.

“—a simple matter of logistics,” he boomed. “You get the wives to manage the ledger books. Keeps them from meddling in affairs of substance. A busy mind is a chaste mind, eh?”

His companions chuckled. The card players glanced over, faces blank. Pieter’s head came up. He looked at the men, then his eyes found me in the shadow. A flicker of something—apology? complicity?—passed between us before he looked down again, his pencil moving faster.

The florid man’s gaze swept the room and landed on me. A woman alone, nursing a drink. A curiosity. His eyes, small and bright like a pig’s, assessed. I stared back, letting my face go empty, a window with the shutters closed.

“See?” he said, not lowering his voice. “Even here. Independence is a draft that chills the hearth.”

Something hot and sharp flared behind my ribs. It wasn’t the gin. It was the tone, the casual ownership in it. I saw Pieter’s shoulders tense. Don’t, I thought at him. Don’t be a fool.

But Pieter was a fool. He stood up. He wasn’t tall, but he was lean, and standing he had a certain taut energy. The room quieted.

“The lady,” Pieter said, his voice clear but with a reediness to it, “is not a draft. She is a citizen. And this is her city as much as yours.”

A beat of silence. Then the florid man laughed, a wet, hearty sound. “Is she? And what are you, her herald? Her little rooster?”

Pieter flushed. “I am saying you will keep a civil tongue.”

“Or what? You’ll sketch me to death?”

One of the man’s companions, younger, with a mean twist to his mouth, stood. “The boy wants to play the knight. Let’s give him a lesson in the lists.”

This was escalating in the worst, most predictable way. Pieter had the courage of principle but not the fists for it. The younger man was already rounding the table. Jan the barman sighed, hefting a thick oak club from beneath the counter. He wouldn’t intervene until the blood or the broken furniture threatened his profit.

I stood up. My chair legs scraped loud on the tile floor. All eyes swung to me.

I didn’t look at Pieter or the florid man. I walked to the younger one, who had paused, confused by this new variable. I stopped very close to him. I could smell the wool of his coat, the onion on his breath. I looked up into his face. My voice, when I spoke, was low, for him alone, but in the silent room it carried like a stone dropped in a well.

“You touch him,” I said, “and I will follow you home. I will learn where you sleep. And one night, you will wake with my knife between your ribs. Not tonight. Maybe not next week. But you will wake to it. Do you understand the transaction?”

His bravado drained. He saw it in my face: I was not bluffing. I was stating a logistical fact. A busy mind is a chaste mind. A dead man is a simple ledger entry.

He blinked, took a half-step back. The florid man spluttered. “See! A harpy! A viper!”

I turned my head slowly toward him. “You are a guest in our city. Finish your beer. Pay your tab. And go back to wherever you keep your wife and your ledger book. The draft from the door will be at your back.”

For a long moment, only the hiss of the stove and the drum of rain on the window filled the space. Then the florid man threw a few coins on the table, stood, and jerked his head at his companions. They left, the door closing softly behind them, swallowing their muttered outrage.

The room remained still. Then Jan gave a single, gruff laugh and put his club away. The card game resumed. The murmur of conversation started up, louder now, peppered with glances my way.

Pieter was still standing by his table, pale, his eyes wide on me. I walked back to my corner, picked up my glass, and drained the last of the gin. The heat was gone. It was just a bitter wash now.

He came over. “Els… thank you. That was… incredibly brave.”

“It was incredibly stupid,” I said, not looking at him. “They’ll be back, or men like them. And they won’t be alone. You painted a target on your own back, and then you stood in front of it.”

“He insulted you.”

“He insulted an idea of me. It costs me nothing.” I finally looked at him. His face was open, earnest, bruised by the world’s carelessness. It made me tired. “Principles are a luxury, Pieter. Like clean paper. Not all of us can afford them.”

“I don’t believe that,” he said, but his voice lacked conviction.

“Believe what you like. Just do it more quietly next time.” I stood, my body aching with a sudden fatigue. The adrenaline was gone, leaving the cold damp and the hollow of my stomach.

“Let me walk you home,” he said quickly.

“I know the way.”

“Please. It’s pouring.”

I looked at his offered coat, his hopeful, ink-stained hand. The kindness was a different kind of debt. But the rain was a ceaseless hammer on the roof, and the walk to my canal-side room was long, and the dark would be absolute in the narrower alleys. Even vipers get cold.

“Walk behind me,” I said. “And don’t talk.”

---

The city at night was a different beast. The rain-slicked cobbles reflected the occasional guttering candle from behind thick, leaded glass. The canals were black ink, swallowing the rain, the houseboats on them dark hulks. Our footsteps were the only sound, mine a firm tap, his a softer shuffle a few paces back. I led him through a maze of streets, past the great bulk of the New Church, past shuttered guildhalls with their stone coats of arms weeping water.

I turned onto the narrow street where I lived, the houses leaning so close overhead they nearly kissed, blocking out the sky. The stench of the canal here was ripe, a living thing of sewage and damp rot. I stopped at a door, paint peeling like a sunburn, and fished the heavy iron key from my pocket.

Pieter caught up, his breath making plumes in the air. He looked at the door, the sagging step, the dark windows above. His artist’s eyes were taking it in, measuring the poverty. I saw the pity start to form in them and killed it with a look.

“You’ve seen me home. Now go.”

“Els… what you did back there. The way you spoke. It was like you’d done it before.”

The rain dripped from the gutter above, a steady *plink-plink* into a puddle. A light went on in a window across the canal, a brief, golden rectangle that illuminated the falling silver threads before shutting off again.

“Everyone in this city has done everything before, Pieter,” I said, my voice flat. “That’s what a city is. Layers of the same things, over and over, like silt in this canal. Goodnight.”

I turned the key and pushed inside, leaving him standing in the rain and the dark. I didn’t bolt the door. I leaned against it, the rough wood against my back, and listened. I heard his footsteps, hesitant at first, then moving away, fading into the city’s wet murmur.

Only then did I breathe out. The hallway was black, colder than the street. I groped my way up the narrow, twisting stairs, my hand on the sticky banister. My room was on the top floor, under the eaves. A garret. A cage with a view of other cages.

I didn’t light the candle. I went to the small, warped window and looked out. The canal below was a strip of black velvet. Down the street, I saw a figure pause under a lone lamp. Pieter. He looked back once, at my window, a shadow looking at a shadow, then he turned the corner and was gone.

I peeled off my wet coat, my dress clinging to my skin. The room held the chill of the day. In the dark, I was just a body, tired and cold. The woman in the tavern who spoke of knives and consequences was a performance, a suit of armor worn for the occasion. It was a good suit. It fit well. But it was heavy.

I lay on the thin mattress, listening to the rats skitter in the walls, a sound as much a part of the city as the bells. The ghost of the gin was gone. The ghost of Pieter’s pity remained. And underneath it, colder and deeper, was the knowledge that the florid man from the South had been right about one thing. I was a draft. And drafts, eventually, must be shut out.

# Chapter 2

## **Chapter 2**

The morning came hard and grey, light seeping through the grime on my window like a stain. My head was a lump of clay, my mouth wool. The memory of the night before assembled itself in sharp, unwelcome pieces: the rain, the men, the threat, Pieter’s face. Foolishness, all of it.

Work was the only antidote. I washed with water from the pitcher, the cold biting into my skin, and put on my other dress, the slightly less worn one. It was a dull blue, the colour of a faded bruise. I twisted my hair, the colour of dirty straw, into a tight knot at my nape and pinned it with bone needles that had once been my mother’s. My face in the sliver of mirror was all angles and shadows, eyes a pale grey that gave nothing back. A serviceable face. It could be forgettable or formidable, depending on the light.

Downstairs, my landlady, Mevrouw de Wit, was waiting in the narrow hallway. She was a slab of a woman, built for blocking doorways, her arms permanently crossed over a vast, apron-covered bosom.

“The rent,” she said, by way of greeting. Her voice was the sound of gravel shifting.

“It’s Tuesday,” I said. “Rent’s due Friday.”

“A reminder. In advance. Given recent… instability.” Her small eyes, like currants in dough, flicked over me. News travelled in the sediment of this city, sinking from taverns to landladies with alarming speed.

“The rent will be there Friday,” I said, my tone leaving no room for discussion. I moved past her, catching the smell of cabbage and caraway that clung to her.

“See that it is,” she called after me. “Or your ‘citizenship’ can be exercised elsewhere.”

The dig was precise. She’d heard about Pieter’s words. I didn’t turn back.

Outside, the city was shaking itself awake. The rain had stopped, leaving the world scrubbed raw and gleaming. Barges were moving on the canals, loaded with barrels and bales. Shopkeepers were rolling out awnings. The air was a cocktail of baking bread, horse dung, and the ever-present damp. I walked with purpose, my clogs *clacking* on the stones, joining the stream of other bodies heading to workshops, markets, warehouses. I was a particle in the city’s daily flow.

My destination was the *Vermeylen* workshop, a three-story brick building squeezed between a tannery and a cooperage. The smell was a potent triumvirate: acrid chemicals, sawdust, and the sweet-rot scent of hides. I entered through the side door, into the clattering, buzzing heart of the place.

A dozen looms stood in rows, their rhythmic *thump-clack, thump-clack* a deafening symphony. Girls and women, from twelve to sixty, sat before them, their hands flying, their eyes fixed on the intricate patterns emerging in the threads. The air was thick with lint that caught in the throat and sunlight that cut through high windows, illuminating the dancing dust motes.

“You’re late, Visser.”

Meneer Vermeylen stood by his office door, a ledger in his hands. He was a thin, desiccated man who looked as if he’d been woven from the same tight, grey thread he sold. His eyes missed nothing.

“The streets were crowded, meneer.”

“The streets are always crowded. Your loom was not.” He made a note in his ledger. A deduction, no doubt. “The Haarlem order. The complex floral. It must be finished by week’s end. No errors.”

I nodded, hanging my coat on a peg. My loom was at the back, near the window that overlooked the tannery’s yard. It was the least desirable spot for the smell, but the light was good. I took my seat, my body settling into the familiar motions before my mind had fully arrived. My hands checked the warp threads, tight as harp strings, then I fed the weft shuttle through the shed. *Thump* with the beater, *clack* of the pedals changing the shed. Again. And again.

This was my skill. My hands understood the language of thread and tension. They could take a design—a curling acanthus, a detailed coat of arms, a scene of biblical submission—and translate it into being, knot by infinitesimal knot. It was work that required absolute attention and allowed for absolutely no thought. My mind could go blank, a blessed emptiness filled only with the mechanical poetry of the loom.

Around me, the other weavers worked in near-silence, broken only by the looms and the occasional muttered curse. We were not a talkative group. Conversation wasted energy and invited mistakes. But I felt their eyes on me, sidelong glances. Word had travelled here, too. The girl who threatened men with knives in taverns. I kept my gaze on my pattern, my face a mask of concentration.

At the midday break, we gathered in the small, dank yard behind the workshop, clutching our bread and cheese. I sat apart on a low wall. Katrijn, a woman my age with a permanent squint from close work, sidled over. She had a sharp, ferrety face and a hunger for gossip that was almost professional.

“Heard you gave some Southern windbags a fright at *De Visser* last night,” she said, her voice low.

“I paid for my drink. They paid for theirs. That’s all.”

“That’s not what I heard. I heard you promised to gut one like a herring.” She took a bite of cheese, watching me. “They say the draftsman stood up for you first. Pieter, is it? The pretty one with the sad eyes.”

I said nothing, tearing my bread into small, precise pieces.

“Careful, Els,” she said, leaning closer. Her breath smelled of onions. “That kind of attention… it’s two-sided. Men like that, they want gratitude. In a specific shape.”

“I don’t know what you mean.”

“You do.” She nudged me with a bony elbow. “Just a friendly warning. A woman’s reputation is a cheaper cloth than what we weave here. It tears easy and can’t be mended.”

She wandered off, leaving the warning hanging in the tannery-tinged air. I looked down at my hands, the fingers strong and nimble, the nails short and clean. They were my livelihood. They were also the hands that had gestured with an imaginary knife. Which were the real ones?

The afternoon was a long, aching stretch of repetition. The floral pattern grew under my hands, a burst of crimson and gold against the deep blue field. It was for a wealthy merchant’s wife in Haarlem, something to hang on her wall to prove she could afford beauty she had no part in making. My back began to scream from hunching. My eyes burned from the focus. But I was ahead of schedule. The work was flawless.

As the light began to fade and the looms gradually fell silent, Meneer Vermeylen made his rounds with his ledger. He stopped at my loom, peering at the work with a critical eye. He leaned close, smelling of ink and stale sweat. His finger, dry as a twig, traced a line of the pattern without touching it.

“Acceptable,” he pronounced. “You will stay late. The Van Dyck commission needs the border finished. The client is impatient.”

It wasn’t a request. Staying late meant a few extra stuivers, but it also meant walking home in the full dark. I thought of Mevrouw de Wit’s reminder, the empty coin purse in my room. I thought of the long, black canals.

“Yes, meneer.”

The others filed out, their voices a sudden, relieved chatter that faded as they left the workshop. Soon, it was just the settling sounds of the building and the frantic scratching of a rat in the wall. I lit the oil lamp at my loom, its small, smoky flame pushing back the shadows only a little. I moved to the other loom, where the Van Dyck tapestry—a hunting scene with dogs and falcons—was stretched. The border was a repetitive geometric knot. Mindless, tedious work. My body protested, every muscle stiff.

I had been working for perhaps an hour when the side door opened. I assumed it was Vermeylen, checking on my progress. But the footsteps were too heavy, too confident.

I turned.

It was the florid man from the tavern. The one with the gold ring. He stood just inside the door, his bulk blocking it. He was alone. He smiled, but it didn’t reach his piggy eyes.

“We meet again,” he said. His voice was too loud in the empty space.

My heart gave one hard, sickening thud against my ribs, then settled into a cold, rapid rhythm. I stayed seated, my hands still on the shuttle. “The workshop is closed.”

“I saw the light. I inquired. The master was most helpful. A small donation to his understanding.” He took a step forward, looking around at the silent looms, the ghosts of labour. “A woman of many talents, it seems. Weaver. Harpy. Fortune teller of knives.” He stopped a few feet from me. “You cost me face last night. In front of my associates. In front of that… boy.”

“You cost yourself that,” I said, my voice steady. “I merely presented the bill.”

“A woman does not present bills to a man.” He said it quietly, a simple statement of cosmic law. “A woman incurs debts. And you, my dear, are now in arrears.”

He reached out, not for me, but for the nearly finished Van Dyck tapestry. His ringed finger brushed the intricate weave of a falcon’s wing. “Such fine work. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it. A spill of oil from this lamp, perhaps. An accidental tear. Your master would be… displeased. The financial repercussions for you would be severe, no?”

The threat was clear, elegant in its cruelty. My livelihood, held hostage. I looked from his smug face to the vulnerable fabric. Hours, days of my life were in that thread. My rent. My food. My fragile independence.

“What do you want?” The question was ash in my mouth.

“An apology will suffice. A proper one. On your knees would be traditional, but we can start with words.” He crossed his arms, waiting. The conqueror.

The *thump-clack* of the looms was a memory in the air. The smell of the tannery was suddenly overwhelming. I saw my hands, pale in the lamplight, resting on the brown wool of the weft. I saw the sharp, steel tip of the shuttle in my right hand. It was not a knife. But it was pointed. And it was real.

I stood up slowly. My knees did not buckle. I did not look at the tapestry. I looked only at him. I took a step forward, closing the distance he had established. I saw a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. He had expected tears, submission, the crumbling of my tavern bravado.

I held up the shuttle, turning it so the lamplight glinted on its metal tip. I spoke softly, as I had to his companion, but now the room was so quiet the words seemed etched into the silence.

“You will turn around,” I said. “You will walk out of this door. You will forget this street, this workshop, and my face. If you do not, I will not wait for night. I will not follow you home. I will show you, right here, that a woman can indeed present a bill. And I will collect it with this.” I gestured slightly with the shuttle. “It will not be neat. It will not be quick. And when they find you bleeding out among the looms, I will tell them a thief came in, a desperate man, and I defended my master’s property. Who will they believe? A stranger from the South? Or a weaver, with her tool in her hand?”

His florid face had gone pale, then mottled with rage and fear. He looked at the shuttle, at my eyes, at the absolute conviction there. He believed me. Because it was no longer a performance. It was the bedrock truth of my survival, laid bare.

He took a step back. Then another. His breath hissed between his teeth. “You are mad,” he whispered.

“I am from here,” I corrected.

He turned and fumbled for the door handle, his dignity in tatters. He yanked it open and vanished into the deepening twilight.

I stood there, the shuttle still raised. The adrenaline was a torrent this time, shaking my limbs. I listened until his footsteps faded away. Then I slowly lowered my hand. I walked to the door, closed it, and slid the heavy iron bolt across. The *thunk* was final.

I returned to my loom. The Van Dyck tapestry was unharmed. My hands were trembling. I clasped them together, hard, until the trembling stopped. Then I picked up the shuttle again. I sat down. I fed the weft through the shed.

*Thump. Clack.*

The rhythm was mine. The night was mine. The debt, for now, was paid. But the ledger, I knew, was still open.

# Chapter 3

## **Chapter 3**

The bolt on the workshop door was for keeping rats and the casual thief out, not for keeping the world at bay. I knew he wouldn’t return that night, but the space felt contaminated. I worked until the border was done, my movements mechanical, my mind a locked room. When I finally blew out the lamp, the darkness was absolute and heavy. I unbolted the door and stepped into the alley.

The city night was its usual self—a tapestry of shadows, distant laughter from a tavern, the slosh of water against a canal wall. But every sound was now a potential footfall, every deeper shadow a possible shape. I walked quickly, my clogs unnaturally loud, my hand in my pocket clutching not a knife (I had none) but the cold, sharp metal of my loom shuttle. It was a poor weapon, but it was a fact in my hand.

I reached my street without incident. The house was dark. Mevrouw de Wit’s room on the ground floor was silent. I crept up the stairs, each creak of the wood a cannon shot in the stillness. Inside my room, I didn’t light the candle. I went to the window and looked down. The street was empty. Just the silver sheen of moisture on the cobbles, the black ribbon of the canal.

Sleep was a fractured thing. I dreamt of taut threads snapping, of patterns unravelling into meaningless tangles, of a florid face laughing silently behind a pane of thick, wet glass.

---

Morning was a grey repetition. My body ached as if I’d been beaten. At the workshop, the rhythms resumed. *Thump-clack. Thump-clack.* Katrijn shot me curious looks but said nothing. Meneer Vermeylen inspected the finished border on the Van Dyck piece with a grunt that might have been approval. He counted out my extra stuivers into my palm, his fingers dry and brief against my skin. The transaction was clean. Nothing about last night showed on his ledger. I wondered what “donation” the Southerner had made, and what story he’d been told.

I was threading a new warp, a mindless but delicate task, when the side door opened again. My head jerked up, my hands freezing. But it was only a boy, maybe thirteen, grubby and breathless. He had a note, which he handed to Vermeylen. The master read it, his lips pursing, then his gaze swept the room and landed on me.

“Visser. You are to go to the *Stadhuis*. The Civic Guard. Room of the *Schout*. Now.”

A cold different from the morning chill settled in my bones. The *Schout* was the city’s chief lawman. The note. It could only be one thing. The florid man had chosen a different currency: official complaint.

The other weavers had stopped. The looms fell silent one by one. In the sudden quiet, Katrijn’s whisper was clear as a bell. “Told you. Attention is two-sided.”

“Finish your warp when you return,” Vermeylen said, as if sending a weaver to the authorities was a common errand. “Your time will be deducted.”

I took off my apron, my fingers clumsy. I felt every eye on me as I walked to the door. The walk to the *Stadhuis*, the city’s grand town hall with its ornate gables and aura of power, was a blur. My mind raced. Would they believe him? A man of commerce, with associates? My word against his. A weaver with a reputation for sharp words and sharper threats. I had no family to speak for me, no husband, no guild brotherhood. I was a single, frayed thread.

I was shown into an antechamber that smelled of waxed wood and anxiety. After an eternity, a clerk ushered me into the *Schout*’s room. It was panelled in dark oak, the windows high and narrow. Behind a large desk sat *Schout* Hendrik van Ruijven, a man with a carefully trimmed beard and the tired eyes of someone who has heard every lie the city can concoct. And standing by the window, looking out with his hands clasped behind his back, was Pieter.

My confusion was momentary, then it hardened into a new, sharper dread. Pieter. Of course. The noble fool. He’d heard, or guessed, and come to “speak on my behalf.” To make things infinitely worse with his principled, poetic innocence.

“Els Visser?” Van Ruijven’s voice was dry, without inflection.

“Yes, *meneer de Schout*.”

“This concerns an incident two nights past at the tavern *De Visser*. An altercation with a merchant, one Maarten van Houten, currently lodging at *The Golden Lion*.”

So he had a name. Maarten van Houten. I stored it away.

“There was a disagreement, *meneer*. It was settled. He and his men left.”

“He claims you threatened his life. With a knife.”

“I have no knife, *meneer*. I am a weaver.” I held out my hands, showing the calluses from the shuttle, the stained fingertips. “My tools are of wood and thread.”

Van Ruijven’s eyes flicked to my hands, then back to my face. He was a reader of people, not of ledgers. “He claims you threatened to follow him and murder him in his sleep. A specific threat.”

“A woman’s words, spoken in fear to make loud men leave her alone. They were effective. They left.”

Pieter turned from the window. His face was strained. “*Schout*, if I may. I was there. The men were drunk and insulting. They threatened me first. Els… Mejuffrouw Visser… she intervened to prevent violence. Her words were a shield, not a sword.”

Van Ruijven held up a hand, silencing him. He looked at Pieter with mild impatience, then back at me. “Van Houten also claims you threatened him again last night. At your place of work. With a… weaving tool.”

So he had complained about that, too. The coward. He hadn’t mentioned his own threat to destroy property, to ruin me. Of course not.

“He came to the workshop after hours, *meneer*. He was angry about the tavern. He made threats against my employment. I told him to leave. I may have picked up my shuttle. I was afraid.” I let a tremor enter my voice. It wasn’t hard. “A woman alone, in an empty building, with an angry man from out of town… what would you have done?”

I was painting a picture now, with different threads. The vulnerable worker. The menacing outsider. It was a pattern the city fathers understood better than one of a woman holding her ground.

Van Ruijven leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. He looked from my carefully constructed fear to Pieter’s earnest concern, then to a paper on his desk. “Van Houten is demanding satisfaction. A formal apology, or a fine for disturbing the peace and threatening behaviour.”

“I have no money for a fine,” I said, which was true.

“An apology, then. Public. At his lodgings.”

That would be the end of me. Word would spread. I’d be marked as a troublemaker who’d been brought to heel. Vermeylen would let me go. No other workshop would take me. Mevrouw de Wit would evict me. An apology was a social death sentence.

“That is not just,” Pieter burst out. “She has done nothing wrong! He is using the law to bully and shame her!”

“The law,” Van Ruijven said coolly, “is a loom. It weaves together complaint, witness, and evidence into a cloth of judgment. The pattern here is… messy.” He tapped the paper. “You, Heer van Houten, have a complaint, but your witnesses are your business associates. You, Mejuffrouw Visser, have a witness—” he nodded at Pieter, “—but he is a friend, and his account is of the first incident only. The second is your word against his.” He sighed, the sound of a man weary of the city’s petty knots. “A trial would be costly and time-consuming for all. And bad for trade.”

He let the silence hang. I saw the calculation in his eyes. Van Houten was a merchant, a node in the city’s commercial network. I was a single weaver, a replaceable cog. The math was brutal and simple.

“Therefore,” he continued, “I will make a ruling. Mejuffrouw Visser, you will pay a nominal fine of one guilder for intemperate language. Heer van Houten, you will be advised that harassing citizens at their place of work after hours is not the behaviour our city welcomes in its commercial guests. Consider this a mutual lesson in civility.”

One guilder. It was a week’s rent. It was food. It was everything. But it was not a public apology. It was a financial bleeding, not a social execution. I saw the compromise, the oily political practicality of it. He was splitting the difference, preserving the peace, and teaching no one anything except where the real power lay.

“I will see the fine is paid, *Schout*,” Pieter said immediately, stepping forward.

“No.” The word left my mouth sharper than I intended. Both men looked at me. Pieter, hurt and confused. Van Ruijven, intrigued. “Thank you, Heer van Ruijven. I will pay the fine. When is it due?”

“By week’s end.” He made a note. “You may go.”

I turned and left the room, my back straight. I heard Pieter’s hurried footsteps behind me in the corridor.

“Els, wait! Please. Let me help. It’s my fault. If I hadn’t spoken up in the tavern—”

I stopped and faced him in the cold, stone corridor. “Yes. It is your fault. Your noble, stupid fault. You lit the fuse and then seemed shocked when the powder keg exploded. Now I am a guilder poorer, and that man’s pride is merely dented, not dismantled. He will tell his friends he had me fined. The story will grow. Do you understand? You didn’t protect me. You made me a character in a story where I get fined.”

His face crumpled. “I only wanted to do what was right.”

“Right is a colour that doesn’t run in the wash, Pieter. It’s a luxury dye. I can’t afford it.” I started walking again, out into the weak midday sun of the square.

He caught up, walking beside me, his voice low and urgent. “Then let me pay the fine. It’s the least I can do.”

“And put myself in your debt? Another kind of ledger. No.” I kept walking, my eyes on the uneven cobbles. “Stay away from me, Pieter. Your ‘right’ is too expensive.”

“I don’t believe you mean that,” he said, but his voice lacked its usual conviction.

I didn’t answer. I walked all the way back to the workshop, feeling his gaze on my back until I turned a corner. When I slipped back into my seat at my loom, the others were at their midday break. The room was empty. I picked up my shuttle. My hands were steady.

*Thump. Cl

## **Chapter 4**

The guildhall’s fine was a stone in my gut, a constant, grinding weight. A guilder. A week’s careful living, a month of small comforts, a buffer against the next horizontal rain. It wasn’t the money, not entirely. It was the ledger of it, my name inscribed in Van Ruijven’s neat, damning script. A public accounting of my insubordination. Pieter’s noble guilt was a fog I’d left behind in the square, but the chill of the judgement lingered.

The workshop felt different when I returned. The empty looms stood like silent witnesses. My own loom, with its half-finished Haarlemmer, was a cage of familiar dimensions. I picked up the shuttle. My hands were steady, but the rhythm was off. *Thump. Clack.* The beat was martial now, a counting of coins with every throw. The wool, once a medium for subtle skill, was just thread, measured in stuivers per ell. I worked until my shoulders burned and the light bled from the high windows. The others trickled back, their chatter a soft, indecipherable wool around me. They glanced, then glanced away. News travelled in this city not on feet, but on the damp air itself, seeping into every crack. I was the woman who’d been fined. The character in the story.

When the master released us, the dusk was a blue bruise over the rooftops. I didn’t go home. Home was a rented closet smelling of damp plaster and my own solitary cooking. Instead, I turned my feet towards the *Vismarkt*. The fishmongers were long gone, their stalls hosed down to a slick, scaleshimmering cleanliness that couldn’t mask the day’s ripe history. The canals here were wider, black mirrors for the gabled houses that leaned in, whispering to one another across the water. This was a different anatomy of the city. Less bone and muscle, more vein and open palm. Wealth flowed here, quiet and deep.

I was navigating the unfamiliar rules. The rule was: a woman alone was a question. The rule was: a question required an answer. I kept my chin down, my gaze ahead, a needle threading through the gathering dark. I had no business here, among the grand houses with their leaded glass windows already glowing yellow. I was a loose thread on the wrong side of the cloth.

A bridge took me over a canal, its arch a stone sigh. On the other side, the houses were narrower, pressed together for support. A sign creaked: a painted lobster, its claws bound. *‘t Gebonden Kreeftje*. The Bound Lobster. Light spilled from its windows, buttery and weak. It was not *De Visser*. It would not have Pieter in it, nursing a wounded conscience. I pushed the door.

The warmth here was thinner, laced with smoke and a sweet, malty smell. A few men looked up from their clay pipes and pewter tankards. Their assessment was slower, less instinctual than the fishermen’s. These were shopkeepers, clerks, men whose hands were stained with ink, not brine. My entrance was noted, filed, and largely dismissed. I was not a novelty here, just an anomaly. I found a small table in a corner where the shadows pooled, my back to the wall.

A serving girl, not much older than me but with a tired sag to her shoulders, brought a pot of beer without my asking. She placed it with a soft thud, a gesture that spoke of long hours and small expectations. “Tuppence.”

I laid the coins on the table. She swept them away. No conversation. It was a transaction of beautiful purity. I drank. The beer was thin, slightly sour, but it cut the dust from my throat. I was listening, not to any one conversation, but to the room’s hum. The dialect here was softer, less guttural, laced with French words and talk of shipments, of tariffs, of the damned English and their wool embargo. This was the language of the ledger, not the sea. I understood it better. My father had spoken this language, hunched over his accounts until the candle guttered.

Two men entered, shaking damp from their cloaks. They took a table near the fire. One was broad, with a face like a friendly ham. The other was whip-thin, his eyes doing a constant, quiet inventory of the room. They fell into talk, their voices a low, earnest rumble. I caught fragments. “…not a question of capacity, but of access. The East India men have the monopoly sewn up tighter than a sail in a gale. A private consortium needs backers who aren’t afraid of a little…”

The thin man’s eyes flickered to me, then away. I held my tankard, looking into its brown depths. A woman alone, drinking cheap beer. A blank page. He leaned forward, his voice dropping further. I heard “…Schout’s office… new levies…” and the other man grunted, a sound of disgust. “Van Ruijven’s a weathervane. He points where the guild money blows.”

My spine straightened a fraction. I took a slow sip.

The ham-faced man noticed my attention. Not my ears, but the simple fact of it. He offered a genial, non-committal nod, the kind given to stray cats who aren’t causing trouble. I gave a slight, neutral dip of my chin in return. No teeth. No invitation. An acknowledgement of shared space. He returned to his conversation.

They were potential allies only in the broadest sense—men who chafed under the same structures, who saw the gears of power and resented their place as grist. They would not help me. But they were a source. A font of the kind of information that was currency in places like this. I learned nothing concrete, but I learned the landscape. The names they cursed, the gates they found closed.

When they rose to leave, the thin man’s hand brushed against my table, jostling my tankard. A small spill spread like a dark star on the wood. “Pardon, *mejuffrouw*,” he said, his voice dry as old paper.

“It’s nothing,” I said, my voice low.

He paused, his inventory-taking eyes resting on my face for a full second. He saw the fine wool of my dress, mended but well-made. He saw the hands that were not a lady’s hands. A calculation ran behind his gaze, and came up with no satisfactory sum. He tipped his hat, a minute gesture, and followed his companion out.

The door had barely shut behind them when it opened again. A different quality of cold entered. Three younger men, their cloaks fine but worn at the edges, their faces flushed with prior drink and a kind of aggressive bonhomie. They brought the outside’s harshness in with them. Their eyes swept the room, landed on me, and stuck.

I felt it like a change in pressure. The quiet clerks at the other tables seemed to shrink into their own smoke. The serving girl vanished into the back.

One of them, the leader with a wispy attempt at a beard and eyes set too close together, sauntered over. He planted a hand on my table, leaning down. His breath smelled of gin and onions. “All alone in the gloom, *meisie*? That’s a poor state of affairs.”

I looked at his hand, then up at his face. I said nothing. A show of teeth was one thing. This required a different silence.

“Cat got your tongue? Or just too good for the company?” His friends chuckled, a hollow sound. “This is a respectable place. A woman drinking alone… people might get the wrong idea.” He let the implication hang, oily and familiar.

This was the clear antagonist. Not a man in power, but a foot soldier of nuisance. His power was borrowed, temporary, fueled by the pack at his back and the assumed vulnerability of my solitude. He was Van Ruijven’s judgement, distilled to its crudest form.

“I have the right idea,” I said, my voice flat. “You are interrupting my beer.”

His close-set eyes widened, then narrowed. A public rebuke. A tiny defiance. It was the kindling he needed. “You’ve a sharp tongue. Maybe you need a lesson in keeping it behind your teeth.”

He reached for my tankard, as if to take it away. A petty dominance. My hand shot out, not to stop him, but to grip the handle firmly. Our fingers did not touch. We were both holding the scarred pewter, a ridiculous stalemate.

“Let go,” he hissed.

“You let go,” I said, quieter.

His friends shifted, their amusement turning to a readiness for something uglier. The room was a held breath.

Then, a new voice, calm and firm, cut the tension like a blade. “Is there a problem, Heer Dekker?”

A man stood from a shadowed booth I hadn’t noticed. He was older, perhaps fifty, with a neatly trimmed grey beard and the sturdy, compact build of a once-sailor. His clothes were dark, unadorned, but of excellent cloth. He held a pipe, unlit, in one hand.

The young man—Dekker—flinched, his bravado leaking away. “Master de Witt. No, no problem. Just… making conversation.”

“It sounded very one-sided,” de Witt said. He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t need to. He walked over, his movements economical. He looked at Dekker’s hand on my tankard, then at Dekker’s face. “The lady is engaged. With her beer. You are engaged with the door. I suggest you both continue with your engagements.”

It was not a request. Dekker’s hand sprang back as if scalded. He muttered something, shot me a look of pure venom, and jerked his head at his companions. They left in a clatter of boots and wounded pride.

The silence they left behind was profound. De Witt turned his gaze to me. It was assessing, but not invasive. He saw the same things the thin man had seen, but his calculation seemed different. “My apologies, *mejuffrouw*. The city breeds more rats than cats some evenings.”

“Thank you,” I said. My heart was a trapped bird against my ribs. I forced my hand to release the tankard. It came away steady.

“May I?” He gestured to the empty chair opposite. I nodded. He sat, not leaning forward in false camaraderie, but upright, his hands resting on the table. “Johannes de Witt. I own a small provisioning concern. And you are caught in the wrong part of town after dark.”

“Els,” I said. It was half the truth. “A spinner. And I find the right parts of town are usually locked.”

A faint smile touched his lips. “A spinner with a taste for politics? You listened to Van Hoorn and his partner earlier with the ear of a clerk.”

So he had been watching. I felt a prickle of alarm, but also a thread of opportunity. “I listen to everyone. It’s cheaper than buying newsheets.”

“And often more accurate.” He took out a small pouch of tobacco and began to fill his pipe with deliberate, careful motions. “Van Ruijven’s new fine for public disturbances is a topic of interest. It seems to fall more heavily on some than others.”

The stone in my gut twisted. He knew. Of course he knew. The story was growing, just as I’d told Pieter it would. “It is an efficient tax,” I said, choosing my words like stepping stones. “It taxes the appearance of disorder, rather than the disorder itself.”

He struck a flint, lit his pipe, and drew on it. The sweet smoke formed a brief, fragrant curtain between us. “You have a mind for systems, Mejuffrouw Els. A valuable thing. A dangerous thing.” He studied me through the smoke. “You work for Master van Aelst? The loom-works by the tannery?”

I nodded, once.

“A good master. Fair. But a guild man to his bones. The guilds…” He paused, choosing his words. “They are like the dikes. Necessary. They hold back the chaos of the sea. But they also determine the shape of the land, forever. They decide what can grow inside the walls.”

“And outside the walls?” I asked.

“That is the question, isn’t it?” He smiled again, this time with more warmth. “There are other ways. Smaller channels. Private contracts. Work that doesn’t require a guild stamp, but requires skill, discretion, and a strong stomach for risk.”

He was offering help. Or the shape of it. Not charity, but a transaction. Crucial information. A potential path around the wall I’d just been fined for bumping into.

“My stomach is strong,” I said. “But my purse is currently light. A guilder light.”

“I heard.” He let that sit. “A man’s pride is an expensive thing to injure. Especially a small man in a large hat.” He took another draw on his pipe. “I may have work for hands like yours. Not at the loom. Finer work. Mending, repairing. The sort of work done in quiet rooms, for clients who value the repair more than the pedigree of the repairer. The pay is better. The questions are fewer.”

It was a lifeline. It was also a door into a world I didn’t know, with rules I couldn’t yet see. “What would it require?”

“A sample of your skill. On material I provide. A meeting, here, in three nights’ time. If the work is satisfactory, we agree on terms.” His tone was that of a merchant, plain and clear. It was a tone I trusted more than Pieter’s fervour or Dekker’s bluster.

“I will be here,” I said.

“Good.” He rose, knocking his pipe gently against the table edge. “Three nights. Ask for the back room.” He placed two stuivers on the table. “For the spilled beer.” Then he was gone, melting into the gloom of the tavern and out the door, leaving behind the scent of good tobacco and possibility.

I sat for a long time, finishing my beer. The small challenges of the evening—navigating the strange streets, parsing the new language, facing down Dekker, parsing de Witt’s offer—lay behind me. I had learned new skills: how to listen in a new key, how to wear my solitude like armour, how to recognise an offer that was not a leash. The guilder was still a stone in my gut, but now it had a counterweight.

When I left *‘t Gebonden Kreeftje*, the night was fully formed, cold and clear. The stars were sharp chips of ice above the crooked rooftops. I walked quickly, my senses sharpened. In a narrow alley, a shortcut I knew, I heard the scuff of a boot behind me.

I didn’t turn. I sped up, my pulse quickening. The footsteps matched my pace. Closer. I gripped the key in my pocket, its metal teeth protruding between my knuckles. A poor weapon, but a weapon.

Just before the alley opened onto my street, a figure stepped from a doorway, blocking the way ahead. The silhouette was lean, hat pulled low. I stopped, turning slightly to face the follower. Trapped.

The figure ahead spoke, Dekker’s voice stripped of its false bonhomie, thin with spite. “Thought you were clever, didn’t you? Getting old de Witt to fight your battles.”

I said nothing, measuring the distance to the alley mouth behind me, to the walls on either side.

“A guilder’s fine is nothing,” Dekker said, taking a step forward. “A lesson in respect, that’s what you need. A private lesson.”

His friend behind me chuckled. The calculus was simple, brutal. I tightened my grip on the key.

Then, from a high window above us, a shutter slammed open with a crack like a gunshot. A woman’s voice, ragged with sleep and fury, shrieked down into the alley. “*Godverdomme!* Silence! I’ll empty a chamber pot on the lot of you, I swear on my mother’s grave!”

A head, wrapped in a linen cap, thrust out into the night. Dekker and his friend froze, caught in the sudden, ridiculous spotlight of a neighbour’s rage. It was a farcical interruption, utterly mundane, and it shattered their predatory tension.

“Piss off, you drunken sots!” the woman yelled, and she did indeed lean out with a sloshing earthenware vessel.

Dekker cursed, ducking instinctively. He shot me a final, furious look. “This isn’t over.”

But it was, for tonight. He and his friend melted back into the darkness, their retreat as swift and shameful as rats from a lantern.

I looked up at the window. The woman was still there, a solid shadow against the light behind her. “Thank you,” I called up, my voice rough.

“Get inside, you fool girl,” she grumbled, but without real heat. The shutter banged shut.

I stood alone in the sudden quiet, the adrenaline making my knees weak. I had faced the challenge, navigated the offer, identified the enemy, and survived the ambush. Not with a show of teeth, but with silence, with calculation, and with the unwitting aid of a stranger’s annoyance. I had learned. I had adapted.

I let myself into my tiny room, bolted the door, and leaned against it. In the absolute dark, I finally smiled. It was not a pleasant smile. It was the smile of a creature learning the shape of its new cage, and finding, in one corner, a loose bar.

De Witt’s offer was a loose bar. The guilder was a lock. Pieter’s debt was a chain of a different make. And Dekker’s spite was a reminder that the city’s teeth were everywhere, not just in the guildhalls.

I lit a single tallow candle. The flame guttered, then held. From my small chest, I took out a piece of fabric, a remnant of fine English broadcloth, too small for anything. And I began, with a needle and thread so fine they seemed made of thought, to mend an invisible tear along its selvedge. It was work for my own eyes, a test for my own hands. The stitch I used was one my mother taught me, a spiral repair that distributed the strain. It was slow. It was perfect.

When I finished, the candle was half gone. I held the cloth to the light. The mend was there, but you had to know where to look. You had to look very, very closely.

I blew out the candle. In the perfect dark, the plan began to form. Not a grand design, but the first tight, careful stitch in a pattern I could not yet see. Three nights. A sample. A back room.

And somewhere out there in the sleeping city, a man with a wispy beard nursed a grudge, and a kind-hearted painter nursed a guilt, and a *schout* in a large hat slept the sleep of the judicious. They were all threads. I was the shuttle.

The hook was set. Not by de Witt, not by the fine, but by my own decision to pick up the needle. To mend something, even if it was just a scrap, on my own terms. The next move was mine. And I would make it in a back room, with a sample of my skill, under the assessing gaze of a man who saw systems, not souls.

The dark felt less like an ending, and more like a held breath.

## **Chapter 5**

The morning of the sample arrived not with a bang, but with a seep. A slow, grey infiltration of light through the high, grimy window of my room. It carried the damp, mineral smell of the canals and the distant, rhythmic thump of pile-drivers building something new on ground that was older than sin. I lay on my narrow cot, listening to the city wake. The scrape of a barge against stone. A shouted price for herring. The clatter of wooden clogs on cobbles. A symphony of getting on with it.

I had been getting on with it for three days. Three days of planning that felt less like strategy and more like the careful laying of a snare in a forest you could not see. My allies were not soldiers; they were a collection of frayed nerves and quiet desperation, bound by a thread I had spun from my own need.

I dressed with a deliberate, almost ritual slowness. My good dress—the one not stained with fryer grease or the memory of Dekker’s leering—was a sober grey wool, high-necked, its only vanity the fineness of its stitching at the cuffs and collar. My own work. My hair I plaited and coiled tight against my skull, a helmet of brown. I studied my face in the sliver of polished tin I used as a mirror. Pale. Shadows like bruises under the eyes. A mouth set in a line that refused to promise anything. I looked competent. I looked severe. I looked like a woman who could be a tool, and nothing more. It was the face I needed to wear.

The first beat of the day was a knock, not on my door, but on the one below. A pattern: two quick, one slow. Pieter.

I found him in the narrow alley behind the lodging house, a silhouette against the bright slash of the canal at its end. He was jittery, turning a worn leather cap over and over in his hands. The debt sat on him like a physical weight, bowing his already slight shoulders.

“He’s been asking,” Pieter said without preamble, his voice low. “Dekker. Came by the yard yesterday. Wanted to know if I’d seen you. Said a woman with your… talents… shouldn’t be wasting them on mending nets.”

The word ‘talents’ was a greasy thing in his mouth. I felt the old, cold anger rise, but I banked it. Fuel, not fire. “What did you tell him?”

“That I hadn’t. Which is true.” He looked at me, his eyes pleading for something—forgiveness, or maybe just a sign that this risk was worth it. “This sample today. If de Witt is impressed… the advance. It’s real?”

“It’s a possibility. Not a promise.” Honesty was a cruelty, but a necessary one. False hope was a thread that snapped. “Your part comes after. Getting the piece out. Can your cousin’s boy be relied upon?”

Pieter nodded, too quickly. “He’s a good lad. Quiet. Sees things.” He swallowed. “He’s afraid of the *schout*.”

“Everyone with sense is afraid of the *schout*,” I said. “It’s why he’ll keep his head down and his mouth shut. Fear is a better guarantee than loyalty.”

He flinched at that, as if I’d commented on the weather of his own heart. I hadn’t meant it as a barb, but it landed as one. The dynamics here were a fragile glass. Pieter, the man, was beholden to me, the woman, for a chance to save his skin. It inverted the natural order of his world, and the strain of it made him both pliant and volatile. A dangerous combination.

“Meet me at the churchyard of St. Nicolaas at noon,” I instructed. “Not before. Watch for Dekker’s men. They’ll be loafing about, looking for trouble to report.”

He nodded again, cramming the cap onto his head. As he turned to go, he paused. “He said something else, Dekker did. Said a woman alone makes her own weather, but even the hardest rain finds the gutter eventually.”

I held his gaze until his eyes skittered away. “Tell Mijnheer Dekker,” I said, my voice perfectly flat, “that gutters have a way of backing up in a storm.”

*

The second beat was Gerrit. I found him not at the tannery—the stink would have clung to us both—but at a small, quiet *koffiehuis* frequented by clerks and minor functionaries. He sat in a corner, a large, still rock in a stream of muted chatter and the clink of porcelain. Before him sat a single, untouched cup of coffee. He looked like a man awaiting a verdict.

I slid onto the bench opposite. He didn’t startle, just lifted his heavy-lidded gaze to mine. The kindness in his face was buried deeper now, under layers of worry.

“You look like you haven’t slept,” I said.

“I haven’t.” His voice was a gravelly whisper. “I keep seeing it. The warehouse. The nightwatch. The… consequences.” He finally picked up the cup, his thick, paint-stained fingers looking absurdly delicate on the handle. “This is madness. A woman, a tanner, and a guilt-ridden fool walking into the Silk Guild’s storeroom.”

“We’re not walking in. We’re being invited into a back room. There’s a difference.”

“Is there?” He took a sip, made a face. “The invitation is for you. For a sample. Pieter and I are… what? Shadows? Your conscience?”

“You’re the distraction,” I said bluntly. “And the muscle, if it comes to it. And you’re the man who knows the value of what we’re looking at, so you can tell me what to take.”

He shook his head, a slow, ponderous movement. “This guilt… it was for a moment of cowardice. This feels like premeditated sin.”

“This is survival, Gerrit. Yours as much as mine. You think de Witt’s ‘system’ has a place for a painter who questions the provenance of his commissions? You’re a thread he hasn’t yet pulled. He will.”

He knew I was right. The fear in his eyes was twin-born: fear of the act, and fear of the man who had made it necessary. The gender of it was subtle, but there. He, the man, was meant to be protector, provider, the one who took risks. Yet here he was, being led into risk by a woman, his role reduced to that of a pack animal and a pair of eyes. It scraped against his nature. I needed that scrape. I needed his discomfort to be sharp enough to keep him alert.

“The plan is sound,” I said, laying it out on the table between us like a hand of cards. “De Witt is a man of routines. His head clerk takes a half-hour for midday prayers at exactly one. The under-clerk is young, vain, and more interested in the new maid from the kitchen than the ledger on his desk. The sample room has a northern light. It’s where they’ll take me. You and Pieter will be in the adjacent anteroom, waiting ‘on my behalf.’ You’ll complain of the chill. Pieter will need to use the necessary. The corridors are a maze. A minute is all it takes. A single, pre-cut bolt of the Venetian crimson. Not the most expensive, but the most easily missed from a stacked shelf. You’ve seen the inventory. You know the one.”

He listened, his face a mask. When I finished, he said, “And if the under-clerk doesn’t fancy the maid that day? If the head clerk has a crisis of faith and stays at his desk? If someone sees him?”

“Then we leave. We take the sample, we thank Mijnheer de Witt for his time, and we leave. The hook remains. We try again, another way.” I leaned forward slightly. “But today, the weather is right. The threads are aligned. I can feel it.”

He studied me, really studied me, as he might a difficult subject for a portrait. “You are very calm for a woman about to attempt theft from the most powerful guild in the city.”

“I am not calm,” I corrected him quietly. “I am focused. There is a difference. Fear is a luxury. Save it for afterwards.”

A faint, grim smile touched his lips. “A lesson from your mother?”

“A lesson from life,” I said, and finished my water. “St. Nicolaas churchyard. Noon. Look like you belong there.”

*

The churchyard of St. Nicolaas was an island of cramped silence in the city’s hum. Ancient, leaning headstones jostled for space under the skeletal arms of elm trees. We gathered by a moss-covered monument to a long-dead burgomaster, our little conspiracy of the indebted, the guilty, and the desperate.

Pieter was a live wire, jumping at every pigeon’s flutter. Gerrit was a statue, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, his gaze fixed on the gargoyle leering from the church’s gutter. I stood between them, the point of the triangle, feeling the push and pull of their energies. The tension wasn’t about the plan. It was in the space between us, in the unspoken words that hung in the damp air.

“This is a mistake,” Pieter hissed, his eyes darting. “We should have a lookout on the street. What if Dekker—”

“Dekker is a vulture,” I cut in, my voice low but absolute. “He circles the obviously dying. We are not dying. We are working. Look at you. You’re a tradesman accompanying a prospective client to the Silk Guild. Act like it.” I turned to Gerrit. “And you. You’re a family friend, providing a second opinion on quality. You have the bearing of a man who knows things. Use it.”

Gerrit’s eyes met mine. “And you?”

“I am the client. A woman with a skill, seeking patronage. Nothing more.” I adjusted the fold of my shawl, a simple, sturdy thing. “The defenses are not locks and guards. They are glances and assumptions. A woman alone is scrutinized. A woman with two men in tow is… explained. We are using their assumptions as our cover. Now, breathe. And follow my lead.”

We walked the short distance to the Guildhall in a tense, silent file. The building was a statement in sandstone and arrogance, its stepped gable adorned with stone swags of cloth and a gilded statue of St. Nicholas himself, patron of merchants, looking benevolently down upon his profitable flock. The great oak door was ajar, a mouth promising both opportunity and digestion.

The moment we crossed the threshold, the atmosphere changed. The noise of the city vanished, swallowed by thick walls and richer silence. The air was different too; dry, carrying the faint, precious dust of silk and wool, and the beeswax used to polish acres of dark wood. Light fell in solemn shafts from high windows, illuminating portraits of stern, lace-collared men who had built this empire with ledger and loom.

A young clerk, his chin barely needing a razor, looked up from a high desk. His eyes passed over Gerrit and Pieter, registering their presence and dismissing them as necessary appendages. They settled on me. There was a flicker—not of suspicion, but of a mild, bureaucratic curiosity. A woman here was unusual, but not unprecedented. Wives of burghers sometimes came. Widows managing estates. I was neither, and he knew it. The calculation was in his pause.

“Mevrouw?” he said, the formal address a cautious probe.

“I have an appointment with Mijnheer de Witt. Regarding a sample.” I kept my voice cool, devoid of the ingratiating warmth most women would feel compelled to offer in such a hall.

He consulted a ledger, his finger tracing down a column. “Ah. Yes. The… textile specialist.” He said it as if the words were in a foreign language. “He is expecting you. The sample room. Hendrik will show you up.”

An older man, with the perpetually stooped posture of a lifetime spent carrying bolts of fabric, emerged from a side door. He nodded wordlessly and led us up a wide, creaking staircase. Our footsteps were muffled by a runner of fine Turkish carpet. The walls were lined with glass-fronted cabinets displaying exquisite examples of the guild’s work: a length of cloth-of-gold, a delicate point de Venise lace, an embroidery so fine it looked like a painting.

It was a museum of value. A temple to commerce. And we were heretics, walking its halls.

The sample room was on the second floor, a long, narrow space with a wall of north-facing windows. The light was perfect, clinical, exposing every fiber. Shelves and wide, flat drawers held thousands of swatches, organized by origin, weave, and dye. The air here was even more potent, a library of scents: the peppery smell of raw silk, the earthy depth of madder, the metallic tang of indigo vats.

De Witt was not there. Instead, a man I recognized as his head clerk, a thin man with ink-stained fingers and a permanent frown, stood by a large table. On the table lay a single piece of fabric, covered by a protective sheet of linen.

“Mevrouw,” the head clerk said, his tone neither welcoming nor hostile. It was the tone of a man assessing a piece of machinery. “Mijnheer de Witt is detained. He has asked me to oversee the initial presentation. These are your… associates?”

“Advisors,” I said. “In matters of durability, and of aesthetic suitability for the intended market.” I gestured to Pieter, then Gerrit. The clerk’s frown deepened slightly at the inclusion of a tanner, but he nodded. The logic—durability—was sound enough to pass without comment.

“Very well. You may wait in the anteroom. The mevrouw will demonstrate.” It was a dismissal, clear and crisp. The gender dynamic was reasserting itself here, within the guild’s belly. I was the specimen to be examined. The men, even my ragged allies, were granted the space of the anteroom, a place of waiting and implied judgment.

Gerrit gave me a last, long look. Pieter just stared at the floor. They filed out, leaving me alone with the clerk and the covered sample.

“Proceed,” the clerk said.

I approached the table. My heart was a steady, heavy drum against my ribs. This was the moment. The performance. I had to be flawless. I laid my small toolkit on the table: my fine needles, my silks, my magnifying lens, my scissors with blades like slivers of moon. Then, with a hand that did not tremble, I drew back the linen cover.

The fabric beneath was a ruin.

It was a doublet front, once magnificent, of Italian cut-velvet. The pattern was a complex pomegranate, the pile a deep, resonant black against a cloth-of-silver ground. Or it had been. Now, a great, jagged tear ran from the shoulder down to the waist, as if it had been caught on a spear or a sharp branch. The velvet pile was matted with what looked like old wine or blood. The silver threads were tarnished and snapped. It was a deliberate insult. This wasn’t a test of skill. It was a test of mettle. To give a woman, a supposed specialist, something so violently damaged was to ask: do you even know where to begin?

The clerk watched me, his eyes noting the first reaction. I let none show. I leaned over the fabric, not touching it, my eyes tracing the wound. I picked up my lens. The damage was even worse under magnification. The weave was stressed, the foundation threads frayed. This wasn’t a simple tear; it was a collapse.

“The nature of the damage?” the clerk asked, his voice dry as the sample-room dust.

“Traumatic,” I said, my own voice matching his in detachment. “Followed by neglect. The contaminant is acidic. Wine, likely. It has set the stain and accelerated the tarnishing of the metal thread.” I looked up at him. “Mijnheer de Witt wishes this restored?”

“He wishes to see if restoration is possible. And to gauge the time and cost such an endeavor would require from a… modestly resourced practitioner.”

The barb was clear. I ignored it. “I will need to assess the underlying structure. May I?” I gestured to my needle.

He gave a curt nod.

This was my element. The world narrowed to the space under my lens. The clamor of fear, the pressure of the impending theft, the weight of Gerrit’s doubt and Pieter’s fear—all of it receded. There was only the problem, and the solution. I selected a needle, fine as a hair. With infinite care, I teased apart a few threads at the edge of the tear, probing the health of the cloth beneath. I tested the strength of the velvet’s anchor threads. I examined the junction of the silver brocade.

The work would be immense. It would require re-weaving sections from the back, using a laying-in technique to rebuild the pile. The silver threads would need to be individually cleaned and re-couched. The stain might never fully lift, but it could be disguised with an in-painting of dye on the individual threads. It would take weeks. It would be a masterpiece of invisible mending.

And it was impossible. A fantasy. De Witt knew it. This sample was a brick wall, presented to see if I would break my hands against it or have the sense to walk away.

But walking away wasn’t an option.

I straightened. “It can be done.”

The clerk’s eyebrows lifted a fraction. “Indeed. And the time?”

“Forty hours of work. Perhaps fifty.”

“And the cost?”

I named a figure that was absurdly high, a sum for a master guildsman working on a prince’s garment. It was a defensive move. If he balked, the negotiation was over, and I could leave with my dignity. If he accepted, the advance would be enough to buy Pieter’s debt three times over.

He did not balk. He simply made a note in a small book. “Mijnheer de Witt will consider it. He will give you his answer by the end of the week. You may leave your card.”

I had no card. “I am lodging at De Visser’s. The message will find me.”

A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. The address confirmed every low expectation. “Very well.” He recovered the ruined velvet. “Thank you for your assessment.”

The interview was over. I had passed, or failed, on terms I did not yet understand. Now came the real test. I gathered my tools slowly, deliberately, buying seconds. As I placed the last needle in its roll, I let my hand brush against the edge of the table. A small, sharp splinter caught the pad of my thumb. I drew in a quick breath, a tiny, pained sound.

The clerk looked up. “Mevrouw?”

“A splinter,” I said, holding up my thumb. A bead of blood welled, dark and perfect. “It is nothing. Forgive the disturbance.”

It was a woman’s weakness. A trivial, bodily complaint. His face softened with a hint of impatience, of condescending pity. “There is a basin in the anteroom. You may see to it.”

“Thank you.” I inclined my head, the picture of embarrassed gratitude, and left the sample room, cradling my hand.

In the anteroom, Gerrit and Pieter were standing stiffly by the cold fireplace. The under-clerk was there, leaning against the doorjamb to the corridor, ostensibly keeping an eye on them. His attention, however, was patently on the sound of female laughter drifting up from the courtyard below—the new maid, no doubt.

My entrance broke the tableau. I went straight to the ceramic basin and ewer in the corner. “A splinter,” I said, my voice slightly breathless. “From the table. Clumsy of me.”

Pieter started forward, genuine concern on his face. Gerrit’s eyes narrowed. He saw the performance.

“Allow me,” Gerrit said, his deep voice cutting through the room. He stepped toward me, his bulk blocking the under-clerk’s view of both me and Pieter. “I have better light here by the window. Pieter, fetch a clean cloth from my bag.”

It was a clumsy, obvious diversion, but it worked because it was so mundane, so predictably male—the big man taking charge of a woman’s minor injury. The under-clerk glanced over, sighed at the fuss, and turned his attention fully back to the window and the laughter below.

It was the moment. The held breath.

Pieter, his face pale but set, didn’t go to Gerrit’s bag. Instead, he took two silent steps to the anteroom door, the one that led not back to the stairs, but deeper into the guildhall’s private warren. He paused, his ear to the wood. Then, with a glance at me—I gave the slightest nod—he turned the handle and slipped out.

The world stopped. Gerrit pretended to examine my thumb, his own hands steady but cold. The splinter was real. The blood was real. The sixty seconds that ticked by in the silent, wax-smelling room were an eternity measured in heartbeats. I could hear the under-clerk humming tunelessly. I could hear the distant, rhythmic thump from the pile-drivers outside, a heartbeat for the city itself.

Then, a soft scrape at the door. It opened. Pieter slid back in, his face sheened with a cold sweat, but his eyes alight with a fierce, terrified triumph. His jacket, which had been loose before, now seemed subtly, irrevocably fuller around his middle.

Gerrit released my hand. “There. It’s out.” He said it too loudly.

I pressed the clean cloth to my thumb. “My thanks.” I turned to the under-clerk. “We are finished here. Please convey my respects to Mijnheer de Witt.”

The under-clerk, pulled from his reverie, straightened. “Of course. This way.”

He led us back down the grand staircase, through the hushed hall, and out into the startling cacophony of the street. The sunlight felt like an interrogation. We did not speak. We did not look at each other. We walked, a trio of perfectly normal people, away from the Guildhall, around a corner, into another, and then into the dank, welcoming gloom of a covered alley.

Only then, surrounded by the smell of wet stone and decay, did we stop. Pieter leaned against the wall, his chest heaving. He fumbled inside his jacket and drew it out: a bolt of silk, tightly rolled. It was a crimson so deep it was almost black in the shadows, but where a sliver of daylight caught it, it burned with the inner fire of a dying star. Venetian crimson. The color of cardinals’ robes and courtesans’ lips. The color of blood and wealth.

Gerrit took it from him, his painter’s fingers stroking the surface with a reverence that bordered on the erotic. “It’s perfect,” he whispered. “The weight… the dye is flawless. Cochineal and kermes, layered. A fortune.”

Pieter let out a sound that was half-sob, half-laugh. “It was there. Just where you said. On the middle shelf, behind the inferior Flemish stuff. The corridor was empty. It was… it was easy.”

“It was not easy,” I said, my voice cutting through their relief. The adrenaline was draining from me, leaving a hollow, shaking cold behind. “It was luck, and timing, and a man distracted by a maid’s laugh. Do not confuse the outcome with the risk.” I took the bolt from Gerrit. It was heavier than I expected. The silk seemed to pulse with a life of its own, a stolen heart. “Now comes the hard part. Turning this into money Dekker will accept, without him knowing its source.”

The dynamics had shifted again. In the alley, in the aftermath, we were no longer client and advisors, nor even leader and followers. We were accomplices. The silk in my hands was the proof of our shared crime. It bound us in a new, terrible equality. Gerrit’s guilt was now tangible. Pieter’s debt had a potential price. And my freedom had taken its first, irrevocable step into the shadows.

But the shift was more profound than that. In the guildhall, I had been the woman, the object of assessment, the one whose minor injury became a tool. I had used their assumptions—of female fragility, of male protectiveness—as the pick to break their lock. The system, the great, male engine of commerce and power, had been momentarily fooled by the very dynamics it insisted upon. I hadn’t broken a rule. I had used the rulebook itself to hide the theft. The realization was a cold, bright flame in my chest. Their world was a pattern, and I was learning to weave myself into its design, not as a thread of gold, but as a flaw, a subtle mis-weave that could unravel the whole.

“We split up,” I instructed, tucking the silk into my own bag, beneath my shawl and toolkit. It made a slight, tell-tale bulge. “Pieter, go back to the yard. Work. Be seen. Gerrit, go to your studio. If anyone asks, we had a disappointing meeting. The sample was beyond repair. De Witt was dismissive. We are dejected.”

“And you?” Gerrit asked, his eyes on the bag.

“I have a piece of silk to hide,” I said. “And a debt to plan the payment of. We meet tomorrow night. De Visser’s back room. Not a minute earlier.”

They nodded, two men taking orders from the woman who held the stolen heart of a guild. They melted away into the alley’s different exits, leaving me alone.

I did not go straight back to my room. I walked, the weight of the silk a secret anchor against my ribs. I walked until the grandeur of the guild district gave way to the cramped, gabled houses of the craftsmen, and then to the wider, poorer streets near the harbor. The light was fading, bleeding from grey to a dull orange at the edges of the cloud cover.

I found myself at the base of the half-built new church, the one whose pile-drivers had been the day’s heartbeat. The skeletal ribs of its vaulting reached into the twilight like the bones of a leviathan. It was a monument to ambition, to a future faith. I stood in its shadow, looking back toward the city center, where the Guildhall’s gable was just a darker notch against the sky.

The hook was no longer just set. It was buried deep. We had taken the first, actual thing. The plan was no longer a pattern of thought in the dark; it was a bolt of stolen crimson silk in my bag. The loose bar in the cage had been tested, and it had held.

But as I turned finally toward my room, toward the tallow candle and the locked chest, a new coldness settled in my stomach. Dekker’s men would be watching Pieter. De Witt’s clerk would be making his report. The *schout* in his large hat might, at this very moment, be hearing a curious story about a woman with a splinter and two nervous men. The city’s teeth were everywhere, yes. And now, we had placed our own fingers between them.

The dark, when I finally reached it and bolted my door, did not feel like a held breath anymore.

It felt like the moment after the trap has sprung, when the only sound is the beating of your own heart in the silence, and the waiting for the cry that tells you what, exactly, you have caught.

## **Chapter 6**

The cold in my room had seeped into the brick, a patient, settled kind of cold that no tallow flame could ever hope to shift. I sat on the edge of my cot, the bolt of crimson silk a heavy, accusing presence on the floor beside me. It was not a treasure. It was a timer, its silent countdown measured in the beats of my own heart. The city’s teeth. We had felt them, and now we waited for the bite.

Sleep was a fractured thing, a series of shallow dips into black water where the faces of Dekker and De Witt and the *schout* swam like pale, bloated fish. I woke before dawn, the taste of metal on my tongue, the phantom weight of the silk still pressed against my ribs. The plan for the meeting in De Visser’s back room was a neat, logical thing in my head—distribution, payment, the next target—but logic felt like a child’s drawing over a crack in the ice. Beneath it, the dark water shifted.

I spent the morning in a state of deliberate stillness, a creature playing dead. I mended a tear in my only other shirt, the needle moving with a mechanical precision that required no thought. I watched the slice of sky outside my high window bleed from black to grey to a sour, milk-white. The normal sounds of the city—carts on cobbles, the distant call of gulls, the shouts of hawkers—felt like a performance, a play put on for my benefit. Every raised voice was a warning. Every silence, a threat.

By the time the light began to fail again, the stillness had become a cage. I needed to move. The meeting was hours away, but the thought of sitting in this room with the silk any longer was intolerable. I would go to De Visser early. I would sit in the main room, drink a small beer, and listen. Information was a currency, and the pub was a mint.

I wrapped the silk in a piece of sacking, then wrapped that in my spare blanket, creating a shapeless, lumpen bundle. It looked like laundry, the kind of poor man’s burden no one glanced at twice. I left my room, the lock clicking shut with a finality that echoed in the empty stairwell.

***

The rain had returned, not the spiteful hurling of before, but a fine, persistent drizzle that beaded on the wool of my coat and made the cobbles slick as eel-skin. The walk to De Visser was a study in peripheral vision. I noted the baker’s boy lingering too long at a corner, the two porters who seemed to be having the same muttered argument outside three different warehouses. Were they Dekker’s? The *schout’s*? Or just men having a bad day? The uncertainty was the point. It was the grindstone against which my nerves were being sharpened.

I pushed into the pub. The warmth was less of a blow this time, more a suffocating blanket. The same smells—sour beer, brine, sweat—but the crowd was thinner, earlier. A few regulars hunched over tables, their conversations a low, private rumble. The barman, a slab-faced man with forearms like cured hams, gave me a nod that was neither welcome nor dismissal. I had become a fixture, then. A woman who came in alone, who drank little, who watched. It was a dangerous kind of recognition.

I took a seat in a corner where my back was to the wall, the bundled silk on the bench beside me. I ordered a beer. As I waited, my eyes traced the grain of the wooden table, the rings of countless glasses etched into its surface. A door behind the bar, low and narrow, led to the back room. Our room. For now, it was just a door.

My beer arrived. I was raising it to my lips when the main door opened again, letting in a gust of wet, cold air and a man.

He was not one of Dekker’s bruisers. He was not a guildsman in fine wool. He was tall, lean, dressed in a dark, serviceable coat that was too clean for the docks but not fine enough for the guild district. His hat was pulled low, shadowing his face, but it was the way he moved that stopped the breath in my throat. A fluid, economical grace, like a man who knew the exact dimensions of every space he entered and how to dominate it. He didn’t look around; he simply absorbed the room, his gaze a physical sweep that touched the barman, the regulars, the shadows, and finally, me.

He held my eyes for a half-second longer than was casual. Then he walked to the bar, not with purpose, but with an inevitability, like water finding a drain. He leaned against it, spoke a few low words to the barman. A glass of clear liquor appeared before him. He did not drink it. He turned, leaning back on his elbows, and surveyed the room again. His face was angular, sharp-planed, clean-shaven. His eyes were the colour of the slate sky outside.

He was a hunter. And I was suddenly, utterly sure that I was the game.

The low murmur of the pub seemed to recede, replaced by the loud, frantic drum of my own pulse in my ears. This was the fear. Not the bluster of Dekker, not the cold bureaucracy of De Witt. This was the quiet, professional attention of the city’s true mechanism. The *schout’s* man. Or something worse. The teeth, given form and focus.

I forced my hand to be steady as I set my beer down. The urge to run was a live wire in my muscles. To bolt for the door, to lose myself in the maze of alleys. But the bundle of silk was a beacon beside me. Running would be confession. Staying was a gamble, a test of nerve against his.

He pushed off from the bar. He did not walk toward me. He walked to a vacant table midway between the door and my corner, and sat. He took a slow sip of his liquor, his eyes never leaving the middle distance, but his awareness was a net cast over the entire room. Over me.

Time stretched, taut and thin. Every scrape of a chair, every cough, was a gunshot. I calculated the distance to the back room door. Could I reach it before he did? Would it even be unlocked? Pieter and Maarten were not due for hours. I was alone, with the evidence, in a trap that had just been sprung.

Then he moved again. Not toward me. He stood, left a coin on his table, and walked out into the drizzle. The door swung shut behind him.

The release of pressure was so violent it felt like a blow. I sucked in a breath, my lungs burning. He was gone. Had it been a test? A routine check? A warning?

I looked down at my hands. They were trembling. I clenched them into fists, the nails biting into my palms. The sharp pain grounded me. This was the crisis. Not a fight in an alley, but this silent, screaming confrontation with the sheer, exposed reality of what we were doing. The enemy was not a person. It was the eye of the city, and it had just blinked, slowly, in my direction.

I could not stay here. The back room was compromised. This whole place was now a painted target. I had to move the silk. I had to warn the others.

I stood, grabbing the bundled blanket. My legs felt unsteady, as if the floorboards had turned to sand. I tossed a coin onto my table and made for the door, my walk a careful, measured thing I hoped looked nothing like the flight it was.

The drizzle had thickened into a proper rain. I turned away from the main thoroughfare, plunging into a narrow alley that stank of wet rot and cat piss. My mind raced. Where? The room was out—if he could find me at De Visser, he could find my lodgings. The half-built church? Too exposed.

A hand closed over my mouth from behind. An arm like an iron bar locked around my chest, crushing the breath from me, lifting me off my feet. The bundled silk fell from my grip, landing in the filthy alley muck with a soft thud.

I thrashed, a silent, frantic animal, my boots scraping against the wet bricks. I tried to bite the gloved hand, to drive my elbows back, but his strength was absolute, a machine of bone and muscle. He dragged me backward, deeper into the alley’s gloom, away from the faint light of the street.

This was the defeat. Not a fair fight, not a contest of wits. This was the brutal, efficient snuffing of a candle. The city’s teeth, closing. My greatest fear, given arms and breath. I had walked right into it.

He hauled me into a recessed doorway, the space so tight his body pressed me against the rotten wood. His mouth was near my ear. His breath smelled of the liquor and of cloves.

“Be still,” he said, his voice a low rasp, devoid of anger or urgency. It was an instruction. “I am not going to hurt you. Yet.”

I went limp, not in surrender, but to make him bear my full weight. He adjusted his grip, just slightly. It was the opening I needed.

I stopped fighting his pull. Instead, I let my head fall back, as if in a faint. Then, with every ounce of strength left in my neck and shoulders, I snapped my head forward and immediately back again. The back of my skull connected with his face with a sickening, wet crunch.

He grunted, a sound of pure surprise and pain. His grip loosened for a fraction of a second. I drove my heel down onto his instep, not the delicate stamp of a lady, but the full, grinding weight of a body used to hard floors and long walks.

He swore, his arm unlocking. I tore free, spinning, slipping on the wet stones. He was already recovering, a dark line of blood from his nose stark against his pale skin. His eyes, those slate-coloured eyes, were no longer cool. They were alive with a deadly, focused light.

There was no time to retrieve the silk. No time for anything but survival.

I ran.

Not out to the street, where he could easily corner me. I ran deeper into the alley, into the labyrinth. I heard his footsteps behind me, swift and sure despite his injuries. I turned a corner, then another, my breath sobbing in my throat. The alleys were a tangled web, but I had walked them for weeks. I knew where the dead ends were. I knew where the fences could be scaled.

I skidded into a courtyard piled with broken crates. A high wall on three sides. A dead end. I heard his footsteps slow behind me, approaching the entrance. He knew it, too.

I did not hesitate. I scrambled onto the crates, the wood slick and splintered. My fingers clawed at the top of the wall, finding purchase on wet brick. I hauled myself up, my muscles screaming. I swung a leg over, just as he entered the courtyard. He didn’t shout. He simply lunged, a predator’s final, efficient pounce.

His hand closed around my ankle. His grip was a manacle. He began to pull.

I looked down at him, his face a mask of blood and intent in the gloom. I had one free leg. I had the wall. And I had the memory of a thousand small indignities, a lifetime of being the one who was grabbed, held, dismissed, cornered.

I did not try to kick free. Instead, I used his own pull as leverage. I braced my other foot against the wall and pushed *with* him, hurling myself backward off the wall, directly at him.

He was not expecting it. A man expects a woman to pull away, to struggle in the direction of freedom. He does not expect her to fly into his arms.

We crashed to the filthy cobbles together, a tangle of limbs. The impact drove the air from his lungs. I was on top of him for a split second, a reversal so complete it was dizzying. My hand found a piece of broken crate—a splintered length of wood, heavy and sharp. I didn’t think. I drove it down.

He moved his head at the last instant. The wood struck the cobble beside his temple with a crack, sending a jolt up my arm. But a long, wicked splinter had sheared off. And it was now pressed against the soft skin under his jaw, my weight behind it.

We were both still, breathing in ragged gasps. The rain fell on us, mingling with the blood on his face. I could feel the frantic beat of his pulse through the wood in my hand.

“The silk is worthless,” I hissed, the words torn from me. “It’s a decoy. Stuffed with rags. You’ve caught nothing.”

His eyes searched mine. Looking for the lie. I held his gaze, letting him see the fury, the fear, the absolute conviction. It was a gamble born of pure, desperate ingenuity. The real silk was lying in an alley a hundred yards away. But if he believed me, the prize was gone. I became a woman with a splinter, not a thief with a fortune.

A long moment passed. The tension in his body, coiled to throw me off, slowly ebbed. Not all the way. But enough.

“Who are you working for?” he asked, his voice still that terrifying calm rasp.

“Myself,” I said. It was the only answer that might make sense of a woman alone in an alley with a fake bolt of silk.

He gave a slow, bloody smile. It was the most frightening thing I had seen yet. “No,” he said softly. “You’re not.”

With a sudden, explosive motion, he bucked his hips, throwing me sideways. The splinter scored a line across his neck as I fell, but it was a shallow cut. He was on his feet in an instant, backing toward the courtyard entrance, a hand to his bleeding neck. He didn’t come for me again.

“A decoy,” he said, nodding as if confirming something. “Clever. Tell your ‘self’ that the eye is open. And it blinks less often than you think.”

Then he was gone, melting into the alley shadows as if he were made of them.

I lay on the cold, wet stones, the piece of shattered crate still clutched in my hand. The tremors took me then, great, wracking shudders that had nothing to do with the cold. I had faced the enemy. I had been caught. And I had talked my way out of the trap, not with a lie he believed, but with a lie he found interesting enough to follow. It was not a victory. It was a stay of execution.

But I was alive. And the silk was still out there.

I forced myself to stand. Every part of me ached. I retraced my steps, moving like a ghost through the alleys. The bundled blanket lay where I had dropped it, half-submerged in a murky puddle. I snatched it up, holding the sodden, filthy thing to my chest. The reward. Not for a victory, but for survival. The knowledge it represented was cold and sharp: our time had just shrunk to a pinprick. The hunter knew my face. He knew we were more than one. And he was not fooled.

I could not go to De Visser. I could not go home. There was only one place left.

I made my way to the craftsmen’s district, to the small, tidy workshop of Gerrit the dyer. It was shut up for the night, but a faint glow came from the living quarters above. I threw a handful of gravel at the window.

After a minute, the door cracked open. Klaas’s face, pale and anxious, appeared. He saw the state of me—soaked, filthy, shaking—and his eyes widened. He pulled me inside without a word.

In the low-ceilinged room upstairs, by the light of a single oil lamp, I told them. Pieter and Maarten had arrived early, their faces hardening to stone as I spoke. I told them of the man at De Visser, the chase, the fight in the courtyard, the lie of the decoy. I unwrapped the blanket. The sacking was soaked, but the crimson silk inside was pristine, a shocking, vibrant wound of colour in the drab room.

“He’s City Guard,” Pieter said finally, his voice hollow. “Not *schout*. Higher. The kind they send when the guilds whisper and money goes quiet.”

“He’s hunting,” Maarten said, stating the obvious that hung in the air like smoke.

“We change everything,” I said, my own voice surprising me with its flat steadiness. “The meeting place. The drop for the silk. The next target. We move not tomorrow, but now. Tonight.”

They looked at me, these two men who had taken orders from a woman. In their eyes, I saw no doubt now. Only a grim reflection of my own resolve. The setback was complete. The plan was in ashes. But from the ashes, we had pulled this one, vital thing: the silk, and the certainty of the hunt.

“What do we do?” Klaas asked, his voice small.

I looked at the bolt of crimson. It was no longer just a commodity. It was a flag. A challenge. And it was the only piece of the board we still controlled.

“We use what we have,” I said. “We finish what we started. But we do it faster, and we do it meaner. He thinks he’s chasing a woman with a splinter. We’ll show him the whole damned tree.”

I assigned new roles, new meeting points in a code of street names and tradesmen’s marks. The silk would be broken apart, hidden in three different dye vats in Gerrit’s workshop, transformed from a bolt into a potential, its colour leaching into other cloth, becoming invisible. We would not sell it whole. We would sell the *idea* of it, to Dekker’s rivals, in whispers.

As they left, one by one, to carry their new orders into the wet night, I was left alone with Pieter. He hesitated at the door.

“He saw you,” he said. “He’ll find you.”

“I know,” I said.

“You should leave the city.”

“And go where?” I asked. It wasn’t a question for him. The city was the cage. But it was also the only world I knew how to fight in.

After he was gone, I sat by the cooling lamp. The adrenaline had burned away, leaving a crystalline clarity. The fear was still there, the cold in my stomach. But it had a shape now. A face the colour of slate. It was a thing I could outthink. Maybe.

I had earned no rest. No safe haven. I had earned a war. And as I listened to the first bells of the night watch sound through the dripping dark, I understood the new silence. It was not the moment after the trap has sprung.

It was the moment you pick up the trap yourself, study its mechanism, and begin to reset it, your own fingers careful around the cold, sharp steel.

# Chapter 7

## **Chapter 7**

The victory tasted of copper and cheap gin. Not the good, juniper-sharp kind from the dockside warehouses, but the raw, throat-scouring spirit Gerrit distilled in a back room behind his vats. We drank it from chipped ceramic cups, the liquid a pale ghost in the lamplight of the workshop. The air was thick with the humid, chemical breath of dye—indigo, weld, the sharp bite of madder—and beneath it, the sweet, cloying rot of wet wool.

“To the tree,” Pieter said, raising his cup. His knuckles were scraped raw, the skin peeling back like old varnish.

“To the splinter,” Klaas countered, a faint, grim smile on his face. He’d lost a tooth in the scuffle at the warehouse. The gap gave his words a soft, whistling quality.

We drank. The gin was a fire in a gut already lined with ash. It was not a celebration of triumph, but a ritual of survival. We had done the impossible. We had taken a piece of Dekker’s world, carved it out from under his slate-coloured gaze, and made it ours. The bulk of the crimson silk was gone now, dissolved into three separate vats of brewing colour. A length of it, however, lay across the scarred worktable between us, a narrow river of impossible red in the gloom. Our reward. Our proof.

“For the widow,” I said, my voice cutting through the low murmur. I ran a finger along the edge. The weave was so fine it felt like cool smoke. “And for the boy’s apprenticeship. The rest goes back into the pot. For the next thing.”

Nods all around. No dissent. The money the silk would bring—sold in careful, untraceable fragments to a Flemish merchant Pieter knew—was a lifeline. It was also a leash. It bound us tighter. The shared risk had become a shared asset. I saw the understanding in their eyes, the men who had, weeks ago, tolerated my presence as a peculiarity of their drowned comrade. Now they looked at me, and then at the silk, and the two things were entwined. I was the plan. The silk was its blood.

Gerrit refilled the cups. “He’ll be turning the city inside out,” he said, not looking up from the bottle.

“Let him,” I said. “He’s looking for a bolt of cloth. He won’t find it. He’s looking for a woman hiding. He won’t find that, either.”

The words were braver than the feeling. The cold in my stomach had not left; it had merely been joined by the gin’s false warmth. I had stood in Dekker’s office and seen the calculation in his eyes, the way he assessed me not as a person, but as a variable in a ledger. A variable that had now proven volatile. He would not make the same mistake twice.

We drank again, to silence. The celebration was a bare, spare thing. A few more words about the Flemish merchant’s route, about the signals to use. Then, one by one, they slipped out into the alley—Pieter to his nets, Klaas to his sister’s tavern, Gerrit to bank the fire under the vats. Each departure was a subtraction of warmth, of solidity. I was left with the length of silk and the deepening quiet.

It was only then, in the solitary lamplight, that the cost presented its invoice.

My body was a ledger of bruises. A tight, purple ache across my ribs where a crate had been shoved against me. A stiffness in my shoulder that spoke of a wrench I hadn’t felt in the adrenaline. But these were entries I expected. The real cost came with the memory of Klaas’s face, just before he left.

He’d paused at the door, the whistling gap in his smile gone. “My sister,” he’d said, the words flat. “The tavern. He knows my face now. If he presses… if they come asking…”

He didn’t finish. He didn’t need to. I had pulled him deeper into the current, and now the undertow was threatening his shore. His loyalty, bought with my promise of a better cut, was now a chain that could drag his family down. I had seen the fear in his eyes, not for himself, but for her. It was a fear I had weaponized. I’d given a brisk nod, a commander’s assurance. “We’ll see to it. New locks. A boy to watch the back.”

But the assurance was cheap tin. Dekker didn’t need to break down a door. A word to the right official, a sudden inspection for vermin or a review of a liquor license, could shutter a place like that forever. The compromise wasn’t in the act of theft; it was in the quiet, spreading poison of consequence. I had asked for soldiers and created hostages.

I folded the silk. Its beauty felt accusatory.

***

Dekker did not rage. Rage was for smaller men, for those who could afford the luxury of lost control. He sat in the back room of a grain-shipper’s office near the Oostelijke Handelskade, a place that smelled of dust and distant, dry places. The man opposite him, a narrow-faced expediter named Rens, had just finished his report. The warehouse was secure. The guards had been replaced. The missing ledger had been reconstructed from duplicate slips. The inventory discrepancy was listed as water damage, vermin.

“And the woman?” Dekker asked. His voice was like a stone smoothed by a river.

Rens shifted. This was the part of the report that was not neat, not containable. “She has… connections. The waterfront. The old *De Visser* crowd. They’ve closed ranks. We’ve asked. No one has seen anything. No one knows anything.”

“Asking,” Dekker said, “is the invitation to lie.” He picked up a paperweight—a lump of raw Baltic amber with a fly trapped inside, forever striving. “We have moved from asking to reminding. Remind them who holds the leases on their cottages. Who grants the permits for their carts. Who decides which fishing boats get priority at the unloading quays. Apply pressure. Not to the woman. To the water she swims in.”

He set the amber down. “The silk is secondary. It is a symbol. She took it to prove she could. To prove *I* could be made a fool of. That is the infection. That is what must be cauterized.”

Rens understood. The object was less important than the precedent. A woman, a nobody from the drowned districts, had orchestrated a strike against his network. She had used his own men’s assumptions—their blindness to a woman as anything but a nuisance or a convenience—as her primary tool. It was an insult that transcended material loss. It was a challenge to the natural order of things, to the silent, agreed-upon architecture of power that kept the city’s engine turning. If it were seen to succeed, if it were allowed to stand, it would be a seed. Others might water it.

“Find the point of her leverage,” Dekker continued, his eyes on the frozen fly. “Everyone has one. A person. A place. A secret. She has made herself a splinter. Very well. We will not grab for her. We will press the flesh around her until she is forced out.”

His forces were not regrouping. They were shifting strategy, becoming less a fist and more a vise. The hunt was no longer for a stolen good. It was for a point of weakness. And Dekker had a lifetime of finding those.

***

The Flemish merchant’s money was a solid weight in the hidden pocket of my skirt. I stood on the widow’s doorstep, a basket over my arm. The street was a canal of mud, the houses leaning against each other like tired old men. The door opened a crack, then wider when she saw it was me. Her face, pale and drawn, was a map of sleepless nights.

“I have it,” I said, low, and didn’t step inside. The less she knew, the less she could betray, even unwillingly. I passed her a small, heavy pouch. “For the rent. For the boy’s fee with the ship’s carpenter. It’s settled.”

Her fingers closed over the leather. They were trembling. She didn’t look inside. She looked at my face, and her eyes filled not with gratitude, but with a kind of terrified awe. “They came around. Two men. Asking after you. Asking if you’d been here, if you’d left anything.”

The cold in my stomach crystallized. “What did you say?”

“I said you were a friend of my husband’s. That you brought soup when I was ill. That I hadn’t seen you in weeks.” The words came out in a rehearsed rush. “They… they believed me, I think. They were polite.”

Polite. That was worse. It meant they were being careful. It meant this was not a blunt search. It was a tracing of contours. Dekker was applying pressure to the water.

“Good,” I said, the word ash in my mouth. “That’s all you ever say. I won’t come back like this again.”

“Is it over?” she whispered, a desperate hope flaring in her eyes.

I thought of the vise, tightening. I thought of Klaas’s sister. I thought of the silent, spreading search that asked polite questions. “The first part is,” I said. It was not a lie, but it was not the truth she wanted. I turned to go, then stopped. From my basket, I took a small parcel, wrapped in plain, grey wool. “For you. Not to sell. For you.”

She unwrapped the corner. A flash of crimson, like a heartbeat in the grey afternoon. A scarf’s worth of the silk. She gasped, her free hand flying to her mouth. She hadn’t touched colour that wasn’t drab or faded in years. It was wealth. It was beauty. It was a flag, planted in the mud of her life.

“I can’t,” she breathed.

“You can,” I said. “Hide it. But know it’s there.”

As I walked away, the true value of the reward finally clarified itself in my mind. It was not the money, though that was a tool. It was not the victory, though that was a fuel. The silk, in that moment, was something else entirely. For the widow, it was a reminder that the world contained things other than grey struggle. For Dekker, it was a symbol of defiance to be crushed. For me, standing in the mud, feeling the eyes of the street upon my back, it had become a measure.

It was the measure of the distance between what we were and what we dared to touch. It was the bright, dangerous line we had crossed. The reward was not the object. The reward was the clarity. The understanding that from now on, every choice would be between the mud and the silk, and that choosing the silk meant living with the fact that you would get both, forever stained together. The beauty and the hunt were now the same thing.

I did not go home. The room over the cooper’s yard was a box to be opened by men with polite questions. I had other holes to disappear into, paid for with coin from a different, older job. As I moved through the thickening twilight, the city felt different. The familiar brick and mist were now a chessboard. The calls of the night watch, the glow from tavern windows, the silhouettes of men in doorways—all were pieces in a game I had forced into play.

The silence I had felt at the chapter’s start was gone. In its place was a new sound: the low, almost imperceptible hum of tension, like a wire pulled taut across the dark. Dekker was pressing on the flesh around me. He would find a soft spot. He would press harder.

And I, with the taste of copper and gin still on my tongue and the memory of crimson against grey wool, would have to decide which piece of the board I was willing to sacrifice next, before the vise closed shut.

# Chapter 8

## **Chapter 8**

The rain had returned, but it was a different animal now. Not the spiteful, horizontal needling of before, but a slow, soaking drizzle that seeped rather than struck. It turned the cobbles into a dark mirror, reflecting the bruised purple of the twilight sky and the occasional blurred yolk of a gas lamp. I kept to the middles of the narrower streets, away from the doorways. Doorways held shapes. Shapes had intentions.

My safe hole was in the Veemkade, a warehouse district that smelled perpetually of wet hemp and rotting fruit. The room was paid for, a cash transaction with a landlord who asked no questions and heard nothing. It was a coffin with a window, overlooking a canal the colour of dishwater. It represented a backward step, a return to the gristle of life before the silk. But the room over the cooper’s yard was a known quantity now, and in this new arithmetic, known quantities were liabilities.

I crossed the Blaak, the open square feeling like a naked expanse. The statue of the old scholar in the centre was a black spike against the sky. My footsteps echoed too loudly. I slowed, not to quiet them, but to listen for an echo that didn’t match my own. The low hum from the chapter’s end was no longer a wire in the distance. It was the blood in my own ears.

A sharper sound cut through the drizzle: a boot scuffing on wet stone, off to the right and behind. Not the random shuffle of a drunk. It was placed, a testing of the ground. I didn’t turn. I altered my course, not towards the Veemkade, but into the labyrinth of the Oude Haven. The chessboard was not abstract. The pieces were moving.

The old harbour was a snarl of leaning gables, net-menders’ sheds, and taverns that were little more than holes in the wall. The air was thick with the smell of fish guts and wet tar. It offered shadows, angles, unpredictability. I ducked under a low-slung pulley, its hook swinging empty, and slipped into the gap between two tall warehouses. The passage was a slit of darkness, the ground underfoot a slurry of mud and discarded shells.

I stopped, my back against the cold, rough brick. Silence, save for the drip from a broken gutter and the distant cry of a gull. Then, the footsteps again. Two pairs. Deliberate. They paused at the mouth of the passage. A low murmur, male. I knew the tone. It was the sound of coordination. Of the hunt.

Dekker was pressing. He’d found a soft spot—my pattern, my known haunts—and he was pressing hard. But he was sending men. He wasn’t here himself. That was a message, too. I was not yet worth his personal attention. I was a stray to be rounded up by the kennel master. The thought was a dry, hot coal in my chest.

I moved deeper into the passage. It opened onto a small, neglected dock where a single barge, half-sunk, listed against the pilings like a tired beast. The only way out was back the way I came, or across the dock and over a low fence into a timber yard. The fence was spiked. The men would be at the passage mouth in seconds.

The mud and the silk. The choice was never clean.

I took three quick steps and launched myself at the side of the sinking barge. The rotted wood groaned under my hands, but held. I hauled myself onto its slanted deck, the world tilting, and scrambled towards its far side, away from the passage. My coat snagged on a rusted cleat, the sound a vulgar rip in the quiet. I froze, crouched in the lee of the small deckhouse.

The two men emerged from the passage. They were silhouettes, broad in the shoulders, hats pulled low. They paused, scanning the dock. One pointed to the fresh gouge in the mud where I’d jumped. His head swivelled towards the barge.

“Come on out,” he called. His voice was calm, professional. It wasn’t a shout. It was an invitation to be reasonable. “Just a talk. Mijnheer Dekker has some questions.”

The use of the name was a tactic. It was meant to paralyse, to make the threat official, inescapable. I said nothing. The drizzle painted a fine film on the worn planks before me.

The other man, quieter, began to move along the dock, flanking wide. He’d cut off the timber yard route. The first man stepped onto the barge. The whole structure let out a low moan. He drew a short, thick club from his coat. Not a knife. Dekker wanted me able to answer questions.

The maths was simple. One on the barge, one on the dock. The one on the barge was the immediate problem. I let him take two more steps, let him commit his weight to the unstable deck. As he passed a coiled, sodden hawser, I moved.

I didn’t go for him. I went for the coil of rope. I kicked it hard, sending it unspooling and snaking across the deck towards his boots. It was a trivial thing, a moment of distraction. He glanced down, his step faltering. It was all the tilt the world needed. I closed the distance, not with a fighter’s grace, but with the direct, inelegant force of a door being slammed. I drove my shoulder into his chest, just as the barge shifted again beneath us.

He grunted, arms wheeling for balance. The club flew from his hand, splashing into the black water. He was bigger, heavier. But the tilted deck was my ally. He stumbled backward, his heel catching on the very rope I’d kicked. He fell with a crash that shook the barge, his head connecting with the deckhouse wall with a damp thud. He went still, a sack of potatoes in the rain.

The man on the dock swore, a sharp, guttural word. He started forward, not running, but with a quick, purposeful stride. He pulled a knife from his belt. The blade caught a sliver of distant light. The rules had changed. The flanker had become the primary.

I was on the high side of the barge, him on the dock below. He had the knife. I had the angle. He stepped closer, within striking distance. I saw his eyes, flat and calculating. He was waiting for me to panic, to try and jump for the timber yard fence.

Instead, I dropped. Not down, but sideways, letting the steep tilt of the deck do the work. I slid down the wet planks, feet first, directly towards him. It was not an attack. It was a collision. My boots slammed into his shoulder and chest before he could bring the knife up. He staggered back, but didn’t go down. He was good. He regained his footing, the knife coming up in a clean, practised arc.

I was on my back on the cold stones of the dock, the wind knocked out of me. He stood over me, a dark column against the sky. No words this time. The invitation was rescinded.

Then, from the passage mouth, a new voice. Light, curious, and utterly out of place.

“Is there a problem, gentlemen?”

The man with the knife froze. His eyes flicked towards the sound. So did mine.

A woman stood there. She was wrapped in a sensible, dark wool cloak, a market basket over her arm. Her hair was tucked under a plain cap. She looked like a hundred other women finishing their evening errands. But no errand brought anyone here. And her voice held no fear, only a mild, inquisitive interest.

The man on the dock made a decision. I was on the ground. The witness was a woman. A minor complication. He turned his head slightly towards her, the knife hand lowering a fraction. “Piss off. This doesn’t concern you.”

It was the fraction I needed. I scissored my legs, sweeping his out from under him. He fell hard, the knife skittering away. I was on him before he could breathe, my knee in his back, my own smaller, sharper knife—the one I kept in my boot, the one for cutting rope, for eating with, for moments like this—pressed against the side of his throat, just below the jaw.

“It seems to concern me,” I said, my voice a rasp in his ear.

I looked up at the woman. She hadn’t moved. She watched, her head tilted, as if observing a peculiar species of bird. Her gaze met mine. There was no sisterhood in it, no solidarity. It was pure, clinical assessment.

“He said Mijnheer Dekker has questions,” I said to her, the words a test.

She nodded once, as if this confirmed a hypothesis. “Then you should not linger.”

“Who are you?”

“A neighbour.” She said it simply. Then she did something inexplicable. She walked forward, past us, stepped neatly onto the listing barge, and peered at the unconscious man. She prodded him with the toe of her shoe. “This one will have a headache. The other will have a grievance.” She looked back at me. “You are in my way.”

I stared at her. The knife-hand beneath me was breathing in shallow, furious gasps. The hum of tension had found a new frequency, one I didn’t understand. This woman was an obstacle, but not the one I’d anticipated. She was a stone in the stream, changing the flow entirely.

I leaned close to the man’s ear. “Tell Dekker his men need better footing.” I stood up, releasing him, but keeping my knife in hand. He scrambled to his feet, his face a mask of fury and humiliation. He looked from me to the woman, who was now calmly waiting for him to move from her path. The sheer, bizarre normality of her stance seemed to unman him more than the fight. He retrieved his knife, shot me a last, venomous look, and went to haul his companion from the barge.

They stumbled back down the passage, a four-legged creature of defeat. The dock was silent again, save for the drizzle and the lap of water against the pilings.

The woman stepped off the barge and adjusted her basket. She made to walk past me.

“Why?” I asked. The word hung in the wet air.

She stopped. She had a plain face, neither young nor old, with eyes the colour of the slate sky. “This is my dock. I collect mussels from the pilings when the tide is out. You were making a mess of it.” She said it with the utter conviction of someone stating the most obvious fact in the world. “Also, Dekker is a pig. He employs louder pigs.” A faint, almost imperceptible curl touched her lip. “I dislike the noise.”

And with that, she walked away, disappearing into the warren of sheds as if she were a shadow retreating with the sun.

I stood there, the adrenaline bleeding away, leaving a cold, sharp clarity. The chase had been disrupted, not ended. Dekker’s men would report. The woman, the ‘neighbour’, was a variable. I had gained a moment, not an escape.

The path to the Veemkade was compromised. They would expect that. The ordinary world was not a place you could simply return to. It had been annexed, its borders patrolled. I thought of the widow, the silk hidden in her grey wool. A flag in the mud. My own flag was tattered, and the mud was rising.

I turned north, away from the warehouse coffins, towards the one place Dekker might not think to look for a rat on the run: the brighter, harder streets near the Exchange. Where the men of business and property kept their private rooms, their discreet clubs, their second lives. It was a different kind of jungle, with different rules. I had a little money left, not from Dekker’s job, but from before. It was the coin of a different person. It would have to buy me a night in a cage of my own choosing.

The final obstacle wasn’t a man with a knife. It was the city itself. Every face a potential informant, every lighted window a possible eye. The chase had become a slow, silent permeation. Dekker wasn’t just pursuing me. He was becoming the very air I had to breathe. The vise wasn’t closing from two sides. It was forming from all around, a pressure building in the atmosphere itself.

I found a place on the Binnenweg, a boarding house run by a widow with a face like a closed ledger. I paid for a week in advance, in cash. The room was clean, bleak, and anonymous. It smelled of soap and dust. I barred the door and stood at the window, looking down at the carriages and the well-dressed men below. The silk district. I was back amidst the texture of wealth, but now I was a burr caught in its hem, a thing that did not belong.

The woman on the dock. Her interference was not an act of kindness. It was an act of housekeeping. She had removed a nuisance from her space. In this new game, that was the only form of alliance I could hope for: the temporary convergence of disinterest.

I lay on the narrow bed, coat and boots still on, my knife on the pillow beside me. The taste of copper was gone from my tongue, replaced by the flat, stale aftertaste of canal water and dread. I had navigated the last leg not with a clever trick, but with the brute-force desperation of a cornered animal, and then by the random, dispassionate intervention of a stranger. I had learned nothing elegant. Only that the mud would always be there, waiting to suck at your heels, and the silk was a target you now carried on your back.

Outside, the city hummed its night-time hymn of commerce and secrecy. Somewhere in it, Dekker was listening to a report. Somewhere, a widow touched a hidden fold of crimson. Somewhere, a woman collected mussels from a dock, undisturbed.

And I, in a clean, quiet room I could not afford, waited for the walls to prove themselves an illusion. The clarity was absolute. The reward was a sentence. The wire was pulled taut, and I was the one now vibrating upon it, waiting for the next pluck, the next note in a song I had no choice but to dance to. The game was no longer on the board. The game was the board. And every square was closing in.

# Chapter 9

## **Chapter 9**

The silence in the clean room became a thing you could wear, a second, tighter skin. It pressed on the eardrums. I lay on the bed for two days, or maybe three. Time was measured by the slant of grey light on the floorboards, by the distant bells marking hours that meant nothing, by the hollow, specific ache of hunger that I ignored until it too became a kind of silence. The widow with the ledger-face left a tray of bread and thin soup outside the door each evening. I waited for the creak of her retreating step on the stairs before I retrieved it, ate without tasting, placed the empty bowl back on the boards. This was not healing. This was a tactical pause. A regrouping in a shallow trench before the final, stupid push over the top.

The clarity I’d felt was a cold, sharp stone in my gut. The game was the board. I was a piece that had been knocked into the mud, wiped clean, and placed back on a different square. The rules had not changed. Only the texture of the squares. Silk here. Stone there. Mud everywhere beneath.

On the fourth morning, or the fifth, the silence broke. Not with a sound, but with an absence. The tray from the night before was gone, but no new one had been placed. The space outside my door was empty. A different silence. I was already on my feet, knife in hand, back to the wall beside the door. I listened to the house breathe. A floorboard sighed somewhere below. The distant clatter of a pan. Normal sounds. Too normal.

The message was elegant in its simplicity. The free ride was over. The temporary convergence of disinterest had reached its terminus. I was no longer a burr in the hem; I was a stain that needed scrubbing out. The widow’s ledger had been balanced.

I packed nothing because I owned nothing. The coat, the boots, the knife, the clothes on my back that had dried stiff with canal salt. I had a little cash left, a few damp notes folded into a inner pocket. It was enough for a meal, or a bullet, or five minutes of someone’s divided attention. I opened the door. The hallway was empty, smelling of wax and boiled cabbage. I went down the stairs like a shadow peeling itself from a wall.

The widow was in the front parlour, her back to me, dusting a porcelain shepherdess with a furious, precise concentration. She did not turn. I did not speak. The transaction was complete. I stepped out onto the Binnenweg.

The silk district in the morning was a performance of civility. Carriages were polished to a liquid black. Shop windows displayed bolts of cloth like frozen waterfalls. Men in dark coats moved with the assured gait of those who owned the ground beneath their feet. I moved through them, a discordant note. My coat was a map of my disgrace. My face was a closed door. They parted around me, a stream around a stone, their eyes sliding away with a practiced, effortless disdain. It was the same look the men in De Visser had given me, just laundered and pressed. The language of exclusion was universal; only the accent changed.

I needed a weapon that wasn’t steel. Information was a currency I couldn’t afford. Leverage was a weight I couldn’t lift. All I had was the one thing they had tried to drown, to silence, to bury in ledger-books and polite aversion: my own inconvenient existence. A woman out of place is a question. I had spent my life trying to erase the question mark. Now, it was the only tool I had left.

I found a café with windows too clean, where the coffee cost more than my room. I took a table in the corner, my back to the wall. I ordered coffee. The waiter, a man with a spine so stiff it seemed to protest his own servitude, brought it with a look that priced the china cup higher than my life. I drank it slowly. I let myself be seen. A feral thing in a gilded cage. Let Dekker’s men find me here. Let them see I was not hiding. Let the wire vibrate.

They came, of course. But not the bruisers from the docks. These were two men in well-cut but anonymous suits. They moved like accountants, but their eyes were not for numbers. They sat without asking, one across from me, one beside, blocking me in. The café did not notice. The performance of civility continued around us, a soundproof bell jar.

“Mevrouw Visser,” said the one across from me. He had a pleasant face, the kind you forget instantly. “You are difficult to account for.”

I said nothing. I took another sip of coffee. The bitterness was a comfort.

“Your uncle is concerned,” said the one beside me. His voice was lower, a soft abrasion. “Your… departure from his care was abrupt. He wishes to ensure your well-being.”

“I am well,” I said. My voice was rough from disuse. “You can tell him his concern is noted.”

The pleasant man smiled. It didn’t touch his eyes. “He insists. We have a carriage outside. A quiet reunion. For your own safety, of course. The city is not kind to women alone.”

The old threat, dressed in new silk. The vise, politely offered. I looked from one pleasant face to the other. They were not here to kill me in this clean place. They were here to disappear me back into the narrative Dekker had written: the unstable niece, the family burden, safely sequestered. A private problem. A woman’s problem. Neatly solved.

I placed the china cup down on its saucer. The click was very loud in my ear.
“No,” I said.

The word hung in the air between us, small and absurd. A pebble against a fortress wall.

The pleasant man’s smile tightened. “I’m afraid it’s not a request.”

“It is from me,” I said. I looked directly at him, held his gaze the way I’d held the stares in De Visser. A show of teeth. “You will tell my uncle I am no longer a member of his household. My debts to that fiction are paid. In blood and water. He can balance his books without me.”

The man beside me shifted. I felt the pressure of his thigh against mine under the table, a physical reminder of my containment. “You misunderstand your position.”

“I understand it perfectly,” I said, my voice dropping to match his. “I am the position. I am the inconvenient truth. You can try to remove me. But you will have to do it here. In front of all these polite witnesses.” I gestured slightly with my chin at the room. “How will you explain it? A fit of female hysteria? A tragic accident with a coffee cup? The story will get out. And silk is fragile. It stains so easily.”

There was a pause. The pleasant man’s eyes flickered, just for an instant, to the well-dressed women at a nearby table, to the shop owner reading his newspaper by the window. The performance had a audience. I was no longer a piece on Dekker’s board. I was a splinter shoved under the fingernail of his public world.

“You have nothing,” the low-voiced man hissed.

“I have this chair,” I said. “I have this cup. And for the next few minutes, I have your complete attention. That is a kind of power. Tell Dekker the game has changed. The board is in the window. Everyone can see the pieces now.”

I saw the calculation in their eyes. The risk assessment. I was a cornered animal, yes. But cornered animals bite. And blood on silk is a transaction that can never be undone.

The pleasant man stood up abruptly. He placed a coin on the table, far too much for the coffee. “For your trouble,” he said, his voice still cordial, but now edged with frost. “We will convey your… sentiments.”

They left as they came, two ghosts in suits, absorbed back into the stream of civility. I sat there until my coffee went cold. My hands were steady. The stone of clarity in my gut had grown hotter, harder. It was no longer just clarity. It was a coal.

***

The sacrifice was not offered. It was demanded.

They found me that evening, not on the quiet Binnenweg, but in the liminal space between the silk and the stone, a narrow alley where the fashionable backs of buildings turned their shoulder to the older, grimier streets. This time, they did not come with polite words. They came with cudgels and the intent to break bones quietly, to make my disappearance a back-alley footnote, a cautionary tale for no one.

There were three of them. Not accountants. These were the men from the docks, the ones with the thick necks and the remembered grudge. Dekker was done with subtlety. The message was clear: if I would not be sequestered, I would be erased.

I fought. Not with elegance, but with the terrible, efficient rage of someone who has nothing left to lose. I used the knife. I felt it bite into meat, grate on bone. I used the brick wall, my boots, my teeth. It was a ugly, grunting, wet affair. The smell of blood and gutter mud rose around us, a familiar perfume. One man went down, clutching his thigh, his scream choked off into a wet gurgle. Another caught my knife across his forearm, cursing.

But the third was behind me. His arm locked around my throat, a bar of iron. The cudgel in his other hand rose. This was it. Not a grand defeat, but a sordid, anonymous end in the mud. The final square.

Then, a shadow detached itself from the deeper shadows of a doorway.

It moved with a silence that was more than the absence of sound. It was a vacuum. A shape, slight and hooded, crossed the two paces between the doorway and the man with the cudgel. There was a flash of pale hand, a twist, a sharp, dry crack like a branch snapping underfoot. The man’s grip vanished. He fell, his head at an angle the body was not meant to hold.

My other two assailants froze. The one bleeding from his arm stared, his face a mask of superstitious dread. The thing in the hood turned towards him. It made no move to advance. It simply stood, a hole cut in the world.

They ran. They left their groaning companion in the mud and fled.

I leaned against the wall, gasping, the taste of blood and adrenaline sharp in my mouth. I looked at my rescuer. The hood fell back, just a little.

It was the woman from the dock. The mussel-gatherer. Her face was calm, placid as a millpond. There was no exertion in her expression, no anger, no pity. Her eyes, in the thin light from a high window, were the colour of the canal at dusk.

“You,” I rasped.

She nodded once. She looked at the man at her feet, then at the one still whimpering in the gutter. Her gaze was that of a gardener considering two slugs among her lettuces.

“They will send more,” she said. Her voice was low, uninflected. “He cannot allow the challenge to stand. You have moved from a nuisance to a threat. He will spend capital to remove you.”

“Why?” I pushed myself upright, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. “Why this? First the dock, now this. What is your interest?”

She was silent for a long moment, her eyes on me, measuring. “You stand in the way,” she said finally. “Not of him. Of the flow. You are a rock in the stream. He is the dam. To remove the dam, the rock must first be… repositioned.”

“I’m not your tool.”

“No,” she agreed. “You are your own. That is the point. But your path and mine… converge. For a moment.” She stepped over the body at her feet as if it were a sack of rubbish. She came closer. She smelled of cold water and wet stone. “He has a ledger. Not of money. Of favours. Of secrets. It is kept in his study, behind the portrait of his dead wife. It is the true foundation of his power. The silk is just the curtain.”

I stared at her. “You want me to steal it.”

“I want you to burn it,” she said. “To take the foundation from under him. The men who owe him, the men who fear him… they will see the dam is cracked. The water will do the rest.”

“And you? What do you get?”

“The stream flows,” she said simply. “My dock remains undisturbed. My world is small. I keep it clean.” She reached into the folds of her dark shawl and pulled out a small, flat key, tarnished black. She held it out. “The service door to the garden. The lock was changed last month. He does not know the smith owes me a favour.”

I looked at the key. It was an answer. It was a deeper trap. It was the only move left on a board where every other square was poison.

“Why me?” My voice was a whisper. “You could do it. You could have done it any time.”

She almost smiled. It was a fleeting, cold thing. “I am part of the stream. I cannot act against the dam directly. It would… upset the balance. But a rock, thrown by chance? A spark from a stray fire?” She tilted her head. “You are already burning. I am just pointing you at the right fuel.”

The sacrifice was not my life. That was being taken. The sacrifice was my last, frayed claim to neutrality, to existing in the cracks. To take the key was to choose a side. To become, willingly, the weapon. To trade the last of my tattered self for the chance to tear his world down.

I thought of the clean, quiet room. The ledger-faced widow. The polite men in the café. The mud sucking at my heels. The taste of copper and canal. The wire thrumming under my feet.

I took the key. It was cold, and it fit my palm as if it had been moulded there.

The woman nodded. “The house will be empty tonight. He dines with the burgomasters. A show of solidarity. The servants will be in the front, preparing his triumphant return.” She looked at me one last time, her gaze stripping me bare. “Be the spark.”

Then she was gone, melting back into the alley’s darkness, leaving me with two bodies, a key, and a sentence I had just pronounced upon myself.

***

The Dekker house was a slab of arrogance in the moonlight, all gabled roofs and leaded windows that stared like blind eyes. I approached from the back, through the ordered, sleeping gardens. The key turned in the new lock with a smooth, oiled click. The disloyal smith had done good work.

Inside, the silence was a wealth of its own. It was a different silence from my rented room—a thick, smug quiet, padded by carpets and polished wood and inherited confidence. I moved through the servant’s corridors, a ghost in a tomb. I knew this house. I had navigated it as a ghost for years. But now I was not a spectral niece. I was a burglar. A toxin in the blood.

The study door was locked. A heavier, older lock. I used the pick I’d fashioned from a hairpin and a bit of filed-down spoon handle, tools of a desperate woman. The mechanism yielded with a sigh. I slipped inside.

The room smelled of him. Of cigar smoke, leather, and the faint, cloying scent of the pomade he used. The moon through the tall window lit the massive desk, the globe, the portrait of his wife—a pale, mild woman who had died of nothing more specific than quiet despair. I went to the portrait. My heart was a cold, hard drum in my chest. No panic. Just a lethal focus.

The frame was heavy. I found the catch, a clever thing disguised as a curl in the painted gilt. It released. The portrait swung outward on silent hinges, revealing a wall safe, dark and metallic.

This was the lock the smith could not help with. This was Dekker’s final confidence. A combination. Numbers of personal significance. I stood before it, my mind utterly still. I was not a safecracker. I was the rock. The spark.

I thought of the numbers that would matter to a man like him. Dates of incorporation. Birthdays he pretended to remember. None felt true. He was a man of transactions, not sentiment. His true sentiment was power. Its acquisition. Its measure.

And then I knew.

I reached out and turned the dial. Not to a date, but to a sum. The first major contract that had lifted him from merchant to magnate. The number I’d heard him cite like a mantra, a foundational myth. I spun the dial. The second, the profit from the first wartime shipment, the one that had sealed his reputation. The third, the estimated yearly revenue when he was named to the guild council.

The last number was not a sum. It was a year. The year his wife died. The year all pretense of being anything other than a pure engine of acquisition had fallen away.

The lock gave a solid, satisfying *clunk*.

I pulled the safe door open.

Inside were no jewels, no stacks of currency. There were documents. Deeds. Bonds. And a single, large, leather-bound ledger, its cover worn dark with handling. I lifted it out. It was heavier than it looked. I carried it to the desk, set it down in the pool of moonlight.

I opened it.

It was not a financial ledger. Columns, yes. But the entries were names. Dates. Brief, cryptic notations. *Van Hertz – canal vote – resolved.* *De Wit – daughter’s situation – contained.* *Officer L. – inspection waiver – gratitude extended.* Payments were not in guilders, but in favours, in silences, in ruined competitors and vanished obstacles. Here was the city’s power, not as a map, but as a circulatory system, and Dekker was the heart. Every pulse of influence, every suppressed scandal, every coerced vote was recorded here in his neat, merciless hand.

This was the dam. The concrete and steel of his control.

From the desk, I took his silver cigar lighter. A beautiful, heavy thing. I flicked the wheel. The flame sprang up, small and perfect and hungry.

I did not hesitate. I did not read another entry. I held the flame to the corner of the first page.

The paper was thick, expensive. It resisted for a heartbeat, then blackened, curled, and caught. The fire ate greedily, its light dancing up, illuminating the room in a new, blasphemous way. I fed it page after page, tearing them out, crumpling them, watching names and secrets turn to ash and heat. The smoke was acrid, sweet with the smell of burning leather and lost power.

I burned it all. Every page. I stood over the growing pile of ash in the cold fireplace, a priestess of a terrible sacrament. This was the defeat. Not of a man, but of a system. I was not cutting off a head; I was poisoning the well.

The last page curled into black lace. The fire began to die.

Then, a voice from the doorway.

“I should have known the rot would come from within the house.”

Dekker stood there, still in his evening coat, a crystal glass of brandy in his hand. His face was not contorted with rage. It was pale, stiff with a disbelief so profound it had frozen him. He looked from the smouldering ashes in the hearth to me, my face lit by the dying embers.

“You stupid creature,” he whispered, the words barely audible. “Do you have any idea what you have done?”

“Yes,” I said. My voice was steady, smoke-roughened. “I have balanced your books.”

He moved then, not towards me, but to his desk, yanking open a drawer. He pulled out a pistol, a sleek, deadly thing. He levelled it at me. His hand did not shake. “For that, there is no currency. There is only erasure.”

I did not flinch. I looked down the barrel, and I smiled. It was not a subtle show of teeth. It was a full, wild baring of them. “Shoot me, Uncle. Add it to the ledger. See if the ash remembers the entry.”

He hesitated. The pistol wavered, just a fraction. He was a man of ledgers, of calculated risks. A shot here, now, in his study, with the ashes of his power still warm… the story would be impossible to control. The rock had not just been thrown; it had shattered the dam’s face. Water was already leaking out. A flood of questions. A corpse would only widen the breach.

The moment hung, suspended. The coal in my gut was a sun.

Then, from the hall, came the sound of raised voices. Anxious servants. The front door bell ringing, insistently. The world was knocking, and it had seen the smoke.

Dekker’s eyes darted to the door, then back to me. The calculation in them was frantic, visible. The dam-keeper seeing the first fatal crack.

“Get out,” he hissed, the word venomous. “Get out of my house. If I ever see you again—”

“You won’t,” I said. I took a step towards him, not away. The pistol tracked me. “You will be too busy. Trying to call in favours from ash. Explaining to the men named in that book why you no longer have their secrets. You built a world on silence, Uncle. Now listen to the noise.”

I turned my back on him. On the pistol. I walked to the French doors that led to the garden. I could feel the aim between my shoulder blades, a cold, focused point of dread. I did not look back. I opened the door. The cold night air washed over me, clean and sharp.

No shot came.

I stepped out into the garden, into the world of broken silence, and I did not run. I walked. The wire was gone. I had not slipped from it. I had sawed through it, and let the whole treacherous structure fall.

***

I emerged not on the Binnenweg, not in the alley, not in any place I knew. I walked until the silk gave way to stone, and the stone gave way to the wooden wharves of a different canal, a commercial stretch where the air smelled of tar and Baltic timber. The sky was lightening to a dirty grey wool in the east.

I was not the same. The transformation was not a shedding, but an accretion. I had worn the mud, the silk, the fear, the clarity. Now I wore the ash. It was in the lines of my hands, the smell in my hair. I was not reborn clean. I was forged dirty. The stray cat was gone. In its place was something leaner, harder—a creature of deliberate tooth and claw, who had looked into the heart of the machine and not blinked, who had chosen to be the spark in the tinder.

The game was not over. Dekker was not dead. But his power was crippled, bleeding out into the gutters of gossip and fear. The woman on the dock had her clean flow. I had my fire.

I had no money. No place. The sentence of my existence was still upon me. But it was a sentence I now carried in my own hand, not one read to me from another’s ledger.

I found a public pump and worked the handle. Icy water gushed out. I scrubbed my hands, my face, watching the soot and blood swirl away in the runoff, staining the cobbles. I could not scrub out the smell of smoke. I did not want to.

From the timber yard, a whistle blew. Men began to appear, shapes in the dawn mist, heading for a day’s labour. I looked at them. I looked at the water, at the city beginning to stir—a city with one less dam, with a new, faint scent of burning on its air.

I had sacrificed my last claim to peace. I had chosen the greater good of the chaos that would now consume my uncle over the lesser evil of my own silent suffocation. I had defeated not a man, but the myth of his invincibility. And I had emerged not as my true self, for I had no idea what that was, but as my only self: the woman who burned the books.

A figure detached itself from the gathering workers and walked towards me. Not a dockworker. A woman in a sensible, dark dress, a basket over her arm. She had a sharp, intelligent face, and her eyes went directly to the lingering smudges on my skin, to the set of my shoulders.

“You look like you’ve had a night of it,” she said, her voice frank, assessing. No pity. No disdain.

I said nothing. I just watched her.

“They say there was a fire in the silk district last night,” she continued, her gaze holding mine. “A small one. Contained to a study. But the interesting thing is the stories that are *not* burning. They’re spreading. Fast.”

I remained silent.

A faint smile touched her lips. “My name is Elara Vossen. I publish a broadsheet. *The Lantern.*” She paused. “It seems I have a sudden surplus of ink, and a deficit of reliable sources. And you… you look like a woman who knows where the bodies are buried. And perhaps why they were put there.”

She held out her hand. Not in help, but in proposition.

I looked at her hand. I looked at the city, waking to a new day, a day with a crack in its foundation. The vibration was gone. In its place was a hum, low and potential. The song was not over. It had just changed key.

I took her hand. Her grip was firm, dry. A new transaction. A new convergence.

“Buy me a coffee,” I said. “And I’ll tell you a story about a ledger.”

# Chapter 10

## **Chapter 10**

The dawn’s grey promise had curdled into a flat, indifferent morning by the time I left Elara Vossen at the mouth of a printer’s alley. The coffee she’d bought was a bitter, granular sludge, but the heat of it had been a second handshake, sealing the contract. Her questions were needles, probing for the seams in the story I’d given her—a sanitised version, all numbers and negligence, no ghosts, no girls in attics. She’d listened, her sharp face a mask of polite scepticism, and I knew the ledger was only an entry fee. She wanted the currency beneath it. She’d get it, in time. When it suited me.

My feet carried me not to the rented room above the chandler’s, but to the canal house. It was a compulsion, a morbid curiosity. To see the cage empty.

The city did feel different. The air, still holding the damp chill of the night’s rain, no longer vibrated with that sub-audible threat. Instead, it buzzed with a new frequency: the chatter of a maid shaking a rug from a window, the clatter of a cart over cobbles, a snatch of song from a barge. Ordinary sounds. But they felt newly minted, fragile. The scent of burning was gone, scrubbed away by the damp, or simply absorbed into the city’s older, deeper smells of wet stone and rotting wood.

I turned onto my uncle’s street. The house stood as it always had, a stern, narrow face of brick and white trim. But the myth of its impenetrability was gone. I saw the cracks in the pointing, the slight warp of the front door where the damp got in. I saw it as a structure, not a fortress. A curtain twitched in the parlour window of the house opposite. Mrs. De Wit, no doubt, hungry for the spectacle of disgrace. I gave her my back, a flat denial of her theatre.

The front door was unlocked.

I pushed it open. The hallway was a tomb of polished silence. No Gerrit looming from the shadows, no scent of starch and disapproval. The only smell was lemon oil and, faintly beneath it, the ghost of last night’s smoke, trapped in the fibres of the rug. I stood on the threshold, my boots leaving gritty halos on the waxed floor. A trespasser in a museum of my own making.

“Anika?”

The voice came from the morning room, thin and frayed. Aunt Marit. I followed the sound.

She was sitting in her usual chair by the cold hearth, a shawl tight around her shoulders despite the room’s stuffy warmth. Her hands were clasped in her lap, but they were not still; they worried at each other, a frantic, silent dance. Her face, when she looked up at me, was the colour of old paper. The change in her was not the profound shift I carried; it was a collapse. The careful architecture of her obedience had lost its central pillar, and the whole structure was subsiding into dust.

“They took him,” she said. Her voice was a dry leaf. “Two men from the burgemeester’s office. Just after first light. He went quietly. He… he looked at me. He didn’t say a word.”

I said nothing. I took off my coat, the one that smelled of damp and fryer grease, and draped it over the back of a Hepplewhite chair. The act itself was a violation. She flinched as if I’d shouted.

“Did you know?” she asked, and the question wasn’t an accusation. It was a plea for a map, for any landmark in this sudden, terrifying terrain.

“I suspected,” I said. My voice sounded foreign in this room, too clear, too grounded. “The ledger. The contracts. They were… inventive.”

Her eyes searched my face, not for lies, but for a reflection of her own terror. She found none. “They said fraud. Misuse of civic funds. They said the investigation would be… extensive.” Her hands twisted. “What will become of us?”

The ‘us’ was the house, the silver, the reputation. The carefully curated performance of respectability. It was the only world she knew how to value.

“You’ll survive,” I said, and it came out colder than I intended. I walked to the sideboard, poured a glass of water from the crystal pitcher. I drank it standing. Another violation. “The money he hid will be found. Some of it, anyway. It will be enough. You are not implicated.”

“Not implicated?” A spark of her old spirit, fanned by fear. “I am his wife. My name is his name. My shame is his shame.” She looked at me, truly looked, and her eyes widened. “Your hands.”

I glanced down. The smudges of soot were still there, ground into the cuticles, the lines of the palms. The woman’s frank assessment had noted them. My aunt saw them and saw the end of the world.

“There was a fire,” I said, placing the glass down on a polished surface without a coaster. “In the silk district. I heard.”

“You’re different,” she whispered. The fear in her eyes curdled into something else—a kind of horrified recognition. “You’re not… you’re not *grieving*.”

I almost laughed. The sound stuck in my throat. “What would you have me grieve, Aunt? The loss of a tyrant? The end of the allowance he doled out like a jailer’s rations?” I took a step towards her. She shrank back. “He kept me small. He kept you small. He traded on our silence. That trade is over.”

She shook her head, a frantic, bird-like motion. “You don’t understand. You’ve made it worse. A man can be a thief, and a wife can mourn a thief. But a man who is brought low by… by *this*…” Her gesture took in my soot-stained hands, my posture, the entire unacceptable fact of me. “The whispers will be cruel. They will say he couldn’t control his own household. That the weakness was in his blood. They will say *we* did this.”

For the first time, I saw the true prison. It wasn’t the house, or the ledger. It was the story. The one where a man’s failure was a private tragedy, but a woman’s rebellion was a public contagion. My uncle’s crime was a masculine failing—greed, overreach. The consequence was a legal process, a civic matter. But my action, my match struck in the dark, was a feminine chaos. It broke a deeper law. I had not just exposed his fraud; I had exposed the fraud of his authority, and by extension, the brittle authority of every man in every house on this street. The scandal would not be his greed, but his inability to smother my spark.

I had not just burned a ledger. I had burned the script.

“Let them whisper,” I said, my voice low. “Their whispers are just air. They kept you in this chair for twenty years. Are you really so afraid to be without them?”

She stared at me as if I were speaking a savage tongue. The gulf between us was no longer one of generation or temperament. It was ontological. She was a creature of the old world, where survival was a negotiation for smaller chains. I had stepped outside and breathed the raw, chaotic air of freedom. There was no common language.

A noise from the hall—a hesitant shuffle. Liesbeth stood in the doorway, her apron crisp, her face a careful blank. But her eyes, those old, knowing eyes, went from my aunt’s crumpled form to my soot-stained, standing figure. A verdict passed in that glance.

“Mevrouw,” she said, her voice dutifully flat. “The kitchen boy is here. He is… agitated. He asks for the jongedame.”

My aunt waved a limp hand, dismissing a universe she could no longer comprehend. I turned and followed Liesbeth out.

In the stark, tiled light of the kitchen, Piet stood shifting from foot to foot. He saw me and his face collapsed with relief. “Miss Anika. You’re here.”

“What is it, Piet?”

“It’s Mevrouw de Keizer. And the others. They’ve… they’ve heard. About the master. They’re at the workshop. They’re asking for you.”

*

The workshop, when I pushed open the door, was not silent. It hummed.

The looms were still. No shuttles flew, no pedals thumped. But the space was full of women. They stood in small groups, not in their usual work rows, but in a loose circle. Clara de Keizer was at the centre, her arms folded over her broad chest. There were girls from the finishing room, their hands usually busy with needles now hanging empty at their sides. Even old Maartje from the dye vats was there, her arms stained a permanent, mottled blue.

The conversation died as I entered. All faces turned to me. It was not the suspicious, sliding glance of the men in De Visser. This was a direct, collective gaze, heavy with expectation and a nervous energy. They were waiting. Not for a man to tell them what to do, but for a sign. For a story.

Clara broke the silence. “They took him, then.”

“They did,” I confirmed, closing the door behind me. The click of the latch was loud in the quiet.

A murmur rippled through them. It wasn’t jubilant. It was the sound of an earthquake felt at a distance—a tremor of unstable ground.

“The orders,” said a young finisher named Griet. Her voice was thin with anxiety. “We have the Van Houten shipment half-woven. The thread is paid for, but the master’s seal… without it…”

“The wages,” said another. “Friday is pay-day. Who holds the purse now?”

They looked at me. The questions were practical, immediate, born of a lifetime of precarity. Their world had been upended, and their first instinct was to find the new walls, to learn the new rules of the cage. The cage was all they had ever known.

I walked to the front of the room, near the silent master’s desk. I did not sit behind it. I leaned against its edge, facing them. I felt the grit of the city still on my skin, the phantom heat of the coffee cup, the firm, dry grip of Elara Vossen’s hand. I had the elixir. It was not gold, or a guarantee. It was a simpler, more terrifying thing: the truth.

“The purse is empty,” I said. The words fell like stones. A few women gasped. “Or it will be, once the burgemeester’s men are done. What wasn’t stolen is frozen. The Van Houten order? The contract is void. Fraudulently obtained.”

The anxiety curdled into panic. I saw it in the tightening of shoulders, the darting eyes. Clara’s face remained stony, but her knuckles were white where she gripped her own arms.

“Then we are ruined,” Griet whispered, a statement of fact.

“No,” I said. The word cut through the rising dread. “You are unemployed. There is a difference.”

They stared, uncomprehending.

I pushed off from the desk. “My uncle’s wealth was a fiction. A theft spread over columns and receipts. This business was a shell he used to launder his reputation and his greed. The work you did here was real. The skill in your hands is real. That is what remains. That is what cannot be seized.”

“Skill doesn’t feed children,” Maartje croaked from the back, her blue-stained hands held out, palms up. A gesture of empty utility.

“Not alone,” I agreed. I reached into the pocket of my dress—not the fine wool of my aunt’s world, but my own sturdy, worn cotton—and pulled out the small, leather-bound notebook Elara had given me. A journalist’s tool. “But it is a place to start. Clara.”

Clara’s eyes narrowed. “Ja?”

“You have run this floor for ten years. You know every order, every client, every thumb’s-width of tolerance on these looms. Could you run it? Not as a foreman for a phantom, but for yourselves?”

The silence this time was absolute. The concept was so alien it took a moment to parse.

“Ourselves?” Clara echoed.

“A cooperative,” I said, giving shape to the idea that had been forming in the acid-bath of my mind since I left the printer’s alley. “No master. No hidden ledger. The women of this workshop own the workshop. You share the costs, you share the profits. You find the clients—the real ones, the honest merchants my uncle bypassed for his larger schemes. You work for each other.”

I was not sharing wealth. I was sharing agency. It was a more radical currency.

“It is impossible,” said Griet, but her voice lacked conviction. It was a reflex, the old world protesting.

“Why?” I asked, genuinely curious. “Because it has never been done? My uncle’s schemes were ‘impossible’ too, until he did them. The only difference is the direction of the flow.” I looked at their faces, saw the first flickers of something besides fear: calculation. Imagination. “The building is leased. The lease is in his name, but with him arrested, the landlord will want a tenant. Or a buyer. The looms are here. The hands are here.”

Clara unfolded her arms. She took a step forward, her gaze sweeping over the silent machinery, then over the faces of the women. “The Van Houten thread,” she said slowly. “We own that, if the contract is void. We could finish it. Sell it direct. Split the proceeds.”

“We’d need a buyer,” someone said.

“I know a buyer,” said another voice, hesitant. It was Liesbeth, who had followed me and stood now in the doorway to the hall. She didn’t enter, but her voice carried. “A chandler on the east canal. Honest. His wife was a weaver. He’d treat with us.”

A spark, jumping a gap.

Then Maartje spoke up, her rasp cutting through. “The dye. The master—*he*—always bought the cheap madder. It fades. I know a source for true kermes. Costs more, but the colour lasts. It would set our work apart.”

*Our work.* The words hung in the air, luminous.

I did not lead them. I did not command. I had simply handed them the key and pointed out that the door was not locked, only heavy. Now, they were putting their shoulders to it.

The hum in the room changed pitch. It was no longer the hum of anxiety, but of low, fervent conversation. Questions flew—legal, practical, financial. They were questions they had never been allowed to ask before. Clara began to marshal them, her voice taking on a new, crisp authority. “Griet, you have a head for numbers. You and Liesbeth will inventory the thread, the finished goods. Maartje, you will come with me to see this chandler. We will need a proposal.”

I watched the new world being woven, not from silk, but from necessity and a sudden, fierce solidarity. The script was being rewritten, line by line, in the language of shared survival. I had given them the spark. They were building the hearth.

As the planning gained a chaotic momentum, Clara broke away and came to me. She stood close, her voice for me alone. “This is a dangerous gift you give.”

“It’s not a gift,” I said. “It’s a return. It was always yours. He just kept the receipt.”

She studied my face, seeing the soot, the shadows, the new, unyielding light in my eyes. “And you? What do you get from this… convergence?”

I thought of Elara Vossen’s proposition, of the ledger as just a beginning. “I get a story that needs telling. And a city that needs to hear it.”

She gave a slow, grim nod. A transaction understood. “Then we will hold this end. You hold yours.” She offered her hand. It was broad, calloused, strong from years of guiding fragile thread under tremendous tension. I took it. Her grip was like a vice, but it did not seek to dominate. It was a test of tensile strength. I met it, and after a moment, the ghost of a smile touched her lips. “The woman who burned the books,” she murmured, repeating the phrase that had begun as my private epitaph and was now becoming a title. “See that you don’t get burned yourself.”

*

I did not return to the canal house. I walked, my path aimless yet deliberate, a needle drawing a new thread through the old fabric of the city. I ended up, as I suppose I knew I would, outside the chandler’s where I rented my room. The ordinary world.

But it was not the same. The window of my room, high under the eaves, looked down on me like the eye of a stranger. The climb up the narrow, reeking stairs felt like entering a museum diorama of a life I had outgrown. The room itself—the narrow bed, the washstand, the single shelf with its few, practical books—was a shell. The creature that had inhabited it had molted.

I lit the single lamp. The glow was weak against the afternoon gloom. I went to the washstand, poured water from the jug into the basin. I took the sliver of soap and began to scrub my hands. The water turned grey, then black. The soot of the fire, the grime of the timber yard, the psychic residue of the ledger—it swirled in the basin, a tangible record of the night. I scrubbed until my skin was raw and pink, but I knew some stains were permanent. They were not on the skin, but in it. A tattoo of consequence.

This was the new ordinary. Not peace, but a precarious, humming potential. Not a home, but a temporary base of operations. Not an identity, but a purpose. I was the woman who burned the books. I was the source for *The Lantern*. I was the silent partner in a weaver’s cooperative. I was my aunt’s shame and my own salvation.

I dried my hands. The knock on the door, when it came, was not tentative. It was a firm, rhythmic tap—official, impatient.

I did not startle. I had been waiting for the other shoe to drop. The city’s new hum had a discordant note in it, and this was it.

I opened the door.

Two men stood on the landing. Not burgemeester’s clerks. These were different. Older, with the weary, implacable eyes of men who have seen every variety of human deceit. They wore dark, unadorned coats. One held a leather-bound folder.

“Anika Visser?” the one with the folder said.

“I am.”

“I am Inspector Bakker. This is Sergeant Hoorn. We are with the Municipal Guard, Special Investigations.” His eyes moved past me, taking in the poverty of the room in one swift, dismissive glance. “We have some questions regarding the fire last night in the property of Mijnheer Hendrik Visser. You will accompany us, please.”

It was not a request. The sergeant’s bulk subtly shifted, blocking the top of the stairs.

The shift was not in their arrival, but in their focus. The fraud investigation was one stream. This was another. They were not here about stolen guilders. They were here about a fire. About a violation of property, of order. A masculine domain had been breached by flame, and the guardians of that order had come, as they always did, for the most likely source of chaos. For the woman with soot on her hands.

I looked at the inspector’s impassive face. I looked at the sergeant’s blocked path. The hook was not a mystery; it was a mechanism, clicking into place. The story was spreading, and now the city’s immune system was reacting. I had chosen the greater good of chaos. Now it was time to see how deep the current ran, and if I could swim in it.

I reached for my coat, still damp, still smelling of the world outside. “Of course,” I said, my voice calm, a flat surface over deep, dark water. “But you’ll have to make it quick. I have an appointment with a journalist.”

# Chapter 11

## **Chapter 11**

The city’s hum had changed key. It was no longer a drone of resigned misery, but a low, complex chord—the grumble of machinery, the distant shout of a foreman, the rhythmic scrape of shovels clearing the last of the charred timbers from the Visser yard. It was a song of work, of salvage. I walked through it now not as a ghost, but as a current within it. The rain, when it came, was vertical. It fell with a purpose, to clean, not to punish. It beaded on the oilcloth of my new coat—a practical, dark-green thing bought with the first of my consulting fees—and ran off in clean rivulets.

My room was no longer a cell. It was an office. The narrow table was stacked with ledgers not my own, with schematics for ventilation systems, with proposed amendments to the municipal code on factory safety. The smell of damp wool and fryer grease had been replaced by the scent of strong coffee, ink, and the faint, metallic trace of type from the proofs Pieter van Houten had begun sending me. The space was still small, still poor, but it had been weaponized. It had intention.

I shrugged off the coat, hanging it on the peg behind the door. From the pocket, I withdrew a single, cream-colored envelope. The paper was thick, expensive. It bore no return address, only my name, written in a sharp, angular hand. I set it on the table, unopened. It could wait. Invitations from the Burgemeester’s newly-formed Industrial Liaison Committee could always wait. They needed the specter of the Visser fire, the living, breathing reminder of what neglect cost. I was their conscience, hired and housed. A useful woman. The irony was a coal I kept warm in my palm.

The knock on my door was not the firm, official rap of the Municipal Guard. It was a quick, syncopated rhythm—one-two, one-two-three. I smiled, a private, genuine thing.

“It’s open, Lena.”

The door swung inward, bringing with it a gust of the canal’s damp air and the vibrant presence of Lena de Wit. She no longer wore the drab, shapeless dress of a Visser floor-girl. Her clothes were still simple—a sturdy skirt, a clean blouse—but they fit. A leather tool-belt was slung low on her hips, a holster for wrenches and calipers. Her hands, scrubbed but permanently etched with the memory of grease, held a paper-wrapped bundle.

“Brought you something,” she said, her voice louder, clearer than it had ever been in the factory’s roar. She tossed the bundle onto the table. It landed with a solid *thunk*. “From the lads. Well, from Kees, mainly. He’s taken over the smithy on Zoutsteeg, you know. Proper partnership.”

I unwrapped the paper. Inside was a metal flask, hammered steel, simple and flawless. It was cool and heavy in my hand. Engraved on the side, in clean, unadorned letters, was a single word: *Vuur*. Fire.

“It’s for your coffee,” Lena said, dropping into the room’s other chair without being asked. “Kees said a consultant shouldn’t be drinking from chipped mugs. Gives the wrong impression.”

I ran my thumb over the engraving. A show of teeth, however subtle. “It’s perfect. Tell him thank you.”

“I will.” She leaned back, surveying the room with a foreman’s eye. “Busy.”

“There’s a lot to do. The new regulations are just words on paper. They have to be forced into the world. Like teeth into flesh.”

Lena nodded. She understood force. “We’re starting the inspections at Van Leyden’s mill next week. The owner’s spitting nails, says we’ll bankrupt him with our ‘womanly nerves.’” She grinned, a flash of white in her weathered face. “I told him my nerves are just fine. It’s his drive-belts I’m worried about. They’re frayed enough to make a saint swear.”

This was the new current. Lena worked for the fledgling Worker’s Safety Guild, a body born from the ashes and the public outcry that followed. Pieter’s articles had done their work, painting not a portrait of a tragic accident, but of a calculated neglect. The public, for a moment, had cared. And in that moment, we had built a lever. Lena was the lever’s point, applying pressure where it hurt.

“How’s your mother?” I asked.

Lena’s smile softened, just at the edges. “Better. The cough’s almost gone. The doctor you sent… he actually listened.” She looked at me, the easy bravado fading into something more complex. “She asks after you. Calls you ‘that sharp angel.’ Thinks you’re too thin.”

“I am too thin,” I said, pouring coffee from the pot on the small stove into the new flask. The metal hissed softly. “It’s a professional asset. Makes me look hungry. Which I am.”

We drank in comfortable silence. The camaraderie was a new, strange fabric. It was not friendship, not exactly. It was the mutual recognition of soldiers who had survived the same trench. We had seen the machinery from the inside, felt its teeth. Now we were outside, trying to jam a spar into its gears. It was enough.

After Lena left, the flask of warm coffee in my hand, I went out. The appointment with the journalist was long past; Pieter was more of a colleague now, a co-conspirator in the daylight. This was a different sort of patrol.

I walked east, towards the canals where the dye-works and smaller machine shops clustered. The air here was still thick with the smell of chemicals and hot metal, but the frantic, desperate pace had eased. Or perhaps I was seeing it with new eyes. I paused outside a three-story brick building, its windows newly cleaned, a fresh downspout gleaming against the soot-stained wall.

A man emerged, rolling a handcart loaded with finished brass fittings. He saw me, paused, and touched his cap. Not a gesture of submission, but of recognition.

“Mevrouw Visser.”

“Mijnheer Bakker,” I nodded. This was not the Inspector. This was a different Bakker, a foreman at the very works Hendrik had cited as “unrealistic” for installing a fire-suppression pump. The city had shamed him into it after the articles ran. A small victory.

“Pump’s in and tested,” he said, jerking a thumb back towards the building. “Cost a bleeding fortune. But the men… they sleep better. The wife nags less.” He said it with a grudging respect. The cost was measured in guilders, but the value was in the quieting of a specific, nightly fear. A masculine worry, so often dismissed as feminine nerves, now validated by hardware and law.

“Good,” I said, and meant it.

I walked on. At a corner pub, the kind Hendrik might have frequented, I saw a group of workers at a table. They were not slumped in exhausted silence. They were leaning over a broadsheet, one of Pieter’s, arguing. I caught the words “ventilation” and “mandatory.” Their disagreement was not about *if* things should change, but *how*. The seed of the idea had taken root. It was no longer my lonely obsession; it was a collective problem to be solved. The chaos I’d chosen had crystallized into a new, fragile order.

The light was fading, bleeding from grey to indigo, when I found myself at the iron bridge overlooking the North Canal. This was where I’d stood that first night, smelling of smoke and failure, the city a cold, indifferent monster. I leaned on the railing, the hammered flask cool through my gloves.

Below, a barge moved slowly, loaded with timber. A man on deck called out to a woman on the tow-path, his voice carrying clear on the still air. A mundane, human sound. The water reflected the newly-lit gas lamps along the quay, not as a shattered mess, but as long, steady pillars of light.

I thought of the girl in the damp coat, pushing into De Visser’s, all show and no substance. A stray cat. She had been driven by a singular, private hurt: an aunt’s shame, a stolen legacy. She had wanted to claim a thing, a building, a name.

I had claimed nothing. And everything.

I had not gotten my inheritance. I had burned it to the ground. In its place, I had built a reputation. It was a colder, harder currency than brick and mortar. It was a tool. Anika Visser, the fire-woman. The consultant. The sharp angel. A useful woman.

The hook the inspectors had tried to set in me had been swallowed, digested, and the line turned back on the fisherman. The fraud investigation had quietly dissolved, lost in the larger scandal of Hendrik’s negligence. The official report on the fire concluded “faulty wiring,” a polite fiction all parties now upheld. I had met their mechanism with a greater one: the mechanism of public shame, of financial pressure, of cold, hard legal code. It was a man’s game, played with a woman’s weapons—observation, patience, the ruthless exploitation of sentiment.

I was not saved. Salvation implied an end, a resting place. This was a perpetual motion. The soot was gone from my hands, but it was etched under the skin, a permanent blueprint. The world was still made of greed and grinding gears, but I had learned the rhythm of the grind. I could place my words, my very presence, like a grain of sand in the right bearing, and listen for the satisfying shriek of friction.

From my pocket, I finally took the cream-colored envelope. I slit it open with my thumbnail. The note inside was brief.

*Mevrouw Visser,*
*Your presence is requested at a private dinner, to discuss the future oversight of the new safety ordinances. The Burgemeester believes a more… integrated approach is warranted. Your unique perspective would be invaluable.*
*Friday, eight o’clock. The House on the Herengracht.*
*S. van der Linde.*

Van der Linde. The Burgemeester’s chief fixer. A man who operated in velvet-lined rooms, who turned progress into policy, and policy into patronage. The invitation was not to a battle, but to a negotiation. They wanted to bring the sharp angel inside, to perch her on a gilded shelf. To integrate the chaos into the system, to blunt its teeth.

I looked from the note to the dark water, to the pillars of reflected light. They wanted to give me a seat at the table. A place where the rules were spoken, not broken. Where influence was a subtle poison in a crystal glass.

A smile touched my lips, thin and without warmth. The girl from Chapter 1 would have been cowed by the paper, intimidated by the address. She would have seen it as an end.

I saw it for what it was: a new kind of door. And I knew, with a cold certainty, that I would walk through it. Not to be integrated. But to learn the new rules, so I could break them better.

I folded the note, tucked it back into its expensive envelope. The hook was always there, in different metal, different bait. The current never stopped. You simply learned to swim upstream.

Turning from the canal, I pulled my collar up against the evening chill. The city’s hum deepened with the twilight, a contented, productive purr. I walked into it, the weight of the steel flask a comfortable anchor against my hip. I had an appointment to keep. A table to set. And a new, more dangerous game to learn.

The House on the Herengracht would be warm, no doubt. Dry. Full of polished men with reasoned voices. I wondered what they would smell like, these men who shaped the world from upholstered chairs. I wondered if they would flinch when I walked in, smelling of coffee, cold water, and the faint, indelible scent of smoke.

# Chapter 12

## **Final Chapter**

The rain was a soft, persistent whisper against the glass, a gentle argument with the city’s old stones. It beaded on the window of the corner office, distorting the view of the Herengracht’s stately, rain-slicked facades into something liquid and dreamlike. Inside, the air was still, holding the scent of beeswax, old paper, and the faint, expensive ghost of Sandalwood from the man sitting across from me.

Simon van der Linde steepled his fingers, a gesture meant to convey thoughtful authority. His suit was the grey of a dove’s breast, his smile a practiced curve. “You see, the proposal is not about containment. It’s about… channeling. Directing that formidable energy of yours into structures that can sustain it, and amplify it. The Burgemeester envisions a civic oversight role, a liaison between the port authorities and the new community safety initiatives. A voice for the practical realities.”

I let the silence stretch, watching the rain trace paths down the pane. A year ago, in *De Visser*, silence from a man like this would have been a wall I felt compelled to fill with my own voice, to justify, to explain. Now, I understood it was a tool. Theirs, and mine.

“A voice,” I repeated, my tone flat. “From a seat at a very long table, I imagine. Where the practical realities get translated into sub-committee reports.”

Van der Linde’s smile didn’t falter, but it cooled a degree. “Progress requires procedure, my dear. The alternative is anarchy. Or,” he paused, letting the alternative hang, “a continued existence on the periphery, where one’s victories are necessarily… messy. And temporary.”

*My dear.* The needle, now sheathed in velvet. I thought of the fryer-grease smell of my old coat, the guttural murmur of *De Visser* falling silent as I entered. The periphery. That’s where they’d always wanted me, where women like me belonged: outside, looking in, or inside only on suffrance, a curiosity. The choice he offered was a classic one: step inside, be legitimized, be neutered. Or stay outside, be powerful in bursts, be alone.

I rose from the leather chair and walked to the window. The canal below was a black mirror, holding the golden coins of streetlamps. A barge slid past, silent. “You’re right,” I said, my back to him. “The fire at the *Westindische* warehouse was messy. Exposing the smuggling ring in the customs house was messy. Stopping the Kinderdijk land-grab was exceptionally messy. For your friends.”

I turned. He was watching me, the polished mask still in place, but his eyes were calculating, re-assessing the equation in the room. I was no longer the sharp, ragged creature pulled from the water, grateful for a towel. I was the woman who had drained that water, poisoned the well for his associates, and now stood, dry and deliberate, in his sanctum.

“I’m not interested in a voice at your table, Meneer van der Linde,” I said, my voice calm in the hushed room. “I’m interested in the ledger.”

A flicker. A tiny crack. “The ledger?”

“The one that doesn’t appear in the sub-committee reports. The one that shows who really owns the derelict properties slated for ‘urban renewal,’ who profits from the safety inspections they delay, which cousins get the tender for the new dike works.” I took a step toward the desk. “The practical reality is that your system runs on two engines: the public one you talk about, and the private one you don’t. I don’t want to lubricate the public one. I want the schematics for the private one.”

He laughed then, a dry, papery sound. “You are proposing blackmail.”

“I am proposing a new understanding,” I corrected. “I don’t take a seat. I become a… consultant. Unlisted. My work continues. But now, instead of breaking your windows to get your attention, I use the back door. And in return, certain windows remain unbroken. Certain ledgers remain private.”

The gender of it was not lost on either of us. He offered the public, masculine sphere: a title, a procedure, a visible but impotent place. I demanded the private, the hidden, the realm of influence and whispered deals—traditionally also a masculine preserve, but one accessed through manipulation, through the informal power they always assumed women wielded in shadows. I was claiming it outright, as a seat of power, not a back alley.

He leaned back, the chair creaking softly. “And if we refuse this… understanding?”

I allowed my own smile, the thin, warmthless one I’d felt on the canal side weeks ago. I reached into the inner pocket of my jacket—not the old wool coat, but a tailored piece of dark tweed—and pulled out a single sheet of paper. I placed it on the immaculate blotter before him. It was a copy of a shipping manifest, a list of container numbers. At the bottom, in my handwriting, was a single name: the Burgemeester’s brother-in-law.

“Then the next mess will require more than a procedural review to clean up,” I said softly. “It will require a new election.”

He looked at the paper, then up at me. The calculation in his eyes was gone, replaced by a cold, clear recognition. He saw not a woman to be managed, but a force to be reckoned with. A counterpart.

“Friday, eight o’clock,” he said finally, his voice devoid of its earlier paternal cadence. It was flat, professional. “There is a dining club. De Zilveren Egel. We will discuss the parameters of your consultancy.”

I nodded. “I’ll bring my own pen.”

I didn’t wait for a dismissal. I turned and walked out of the office, past the silent, curious secretary, and into the carpeted hall. The warmth of the building was climate-controlled, scentless, a different kind of physical blow than *De Visser’s* had been. It was the warmth of preserved power, of decisions made far from the rain.

*

The rain had settled into a drizzle as I walked. I didn’t head for the tram or call a cab. I walked east, leaving the symmetrical grace of the Herengracht for the tighter, darker arteries of the old port district. The smells changed gradually: less wax and perfume, more wet stone, diesel, and the ripe, living smell of the river.

I found myself outside *De Visser*. The neon sign buzzed, flickering slightly, painting the wet cobbles a sickly orange. I pushed the door open.

The warmth inside was a familiar embrace, thick with the smell of stale beer, brine, and the honest sweat of a day’s labor. The conversation—a low, guttural murmur—did not lull. A few heads turned, but the glances were different now. There was no curiosity, no challenge. A man at the bar—Pieter, who worked the winches on the *Komet*—gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod. Another, at a corner table, raised his glass a half-inch before returning to his conversation.

I was no longer a woman out of place. I was a feature of the landscape. The woman who had broken the *Westindische* syndicate. The one who’d made sure the widow Van Holt got her pension after her husband was killed in a “flagged” accident. I had earned my silence here.

Marta was behind the bar, polishing a glass with a cloth. She saw me and her face, usually a monument of weary stoicism, softened at the edges. “The usual?”

“Please.”

She poured a *jenever*, the glass clinking softly against the bottle’s neck. She set it before me, then leaned her elbows on the bar, lowering her voice. “Heard you had a meeting with the velvet glove.”

News traveled fast in the right channels. “I did.”

“And?”

“We reached an understanding. He keeps his velvet clean. I keep my knives sharp.”

Marta snorted, a short, approving sound. “Good. Men like that, they think a chair is a gift. They don’t know it’s just another thing to tie you down.” She looked me over. “You look different. Not just the clothes.”

I knew what she meant. The anxiety that used to live in my shoulders, the constant hum of *what if I’m wrong, what if they see through me*, was gone. It had been replaced by a low, steady current of certainty. I had been wrong. I had been seen through. And I had survived it. I had used it. The fear hadn’t vanished; it had been metabolized into fuel.

“I’m not waiting for the hook anymore, Marta,” I said, sipping the sharp, clean liquor. “I’m reading the current.”

She gave that nod, the one that was the highest form of praise in this room. “About time.”

I finished my drink, the heat of it spreading through my chest. I left coins on the bar, another ritual now understood. As I turned to go, the door opened, letting in a gust of damp air and a young woman. She was maybe twenty, her coat too thin for the weather, her eyes scanning the room with a mixture of defiance and trepidation. The conversation dipped, just for a second. Heads turned.

She saw the looks, hunched her shoulders, and made for a small, empty table near the back, trying to project an indifference she clearly didn’t feel.

I stopped. I felt every eye in the room, felt the weight of the moment. The old script demanded I leave, that I mind my own business, that I prove I belonged by not rocking this particular boat. The new script, the one I was writing, demanded something else.

I walked over to her table. She looked up, wary, ready for a challenge.

“The *jenever* is good here,” I said, my voice neutral. “But the *bitterballen* are better if you’re hungry. Marta behind the bar knows everyone. If you’re looking for work, tell her what you can do. If you’re in trouble, tell her what you need. She doesn’t suffer fools, but she doesn’t judge the desperate either.”

The girl stared at me, her defiance melting into confusion, then a dawning, cautious understanding. She gave a tiny nod.

I didn’t smile. I just returned the nod, then turned and walked out, leaving the warmth of the bodies and the murmur of their talk behind me.

*

The apartment was quiet. It was no longer just a place to hide; it was a place to think. The files were gone from the floor, sorted, actioned, or archived. A single, sturdy desk stood by the window, holding a modern telephone, a ledger of my own, and a framed photograph: me and the team from the *Komet*, taken the day after the customs house sting, all of us grinning under a pale spring sun.

I shrugged off my tweed jacket and hung it up. From a small cabinet, I took out the steel flask. It was dented, its surface scratched from a year in my pocket, through fights and flights and long, cold watches. I unscrewed the cap and poured a measure of the same *jenever* into a small glass. I didn’t drink to forget or to fortify myself. I drank to mark the moment. To taste the difference.

I sat at the desk and opened my ledger. Not Van der Linde’s hidden one, but mine. A record of balances. Debts settled. Promises kept. Loose ends. There were fewer now. The thread of the *Westindische* fire was tied off, its arsonist awaiting trial, his backers nervously silent. The Kinderdijk land scheme was unspooled, the documents now in the hands of a newspaper editor who owed me nothing but a good story. The man who had tried to have me drowned in the cold canal water was serving time for tax evasion, a fittingly mundane end.

The major threads were resolved. But a story isn’t a piece of knitting; it doesn’t end with a neat, clipped yarn. It frays into the future. My thread was now woven into the fabric of the city—into the wary respect of the port, into the cold calculus of the Herengracht, into the uncertain hope in a young woman’s eyes in a bar. I was part of its ecosystem now, a predator, a cleaner, a fixed point.

The lens through which I’d seen everything—gender—hadn’t shattered. It had clarified. It was no longer just a barrier; it was a tool, a disguise, a weapon, a source of strength they consistently underestimated. I hadn’t overcome it. I had integrated it. I was not a woman acting like a man in a man’s world. I was a woman operating in a world I was helping to reshape, using every tool my experience had given me.

I closed the ledger. The invitation to De Zilveren Egel lay beside it. A new door. A more dangerous game, played on polished floors with unspoken rules. I felt no anxiety, only a focused curiosity. I would go. I would listen. I would learn the new language of power, the one spoken in nods and silences and the strategic placement of names. And I would use it, not to join their club, but to ensure my own territory remained inviolate. To ensure that the Martas of this city had a little more leverage, that the young women walking into hostile rooms felt a little less alone.

The rain had stopped. Outside, the city gleamed under a sky washed clean, the lights of the port and the stadhuis reflecting in the countless puddles like scattered constellations. The hum was there, the deep, contented purr, but I could hear the individual notes within it now: the groan of a ship, the distant clang of a tram, the laughter from an open café door.

I finished the *jenever*, the final warmth of it spreading through me. I placed the glass down, the click firm and final in the quiet room.

I had arrived here a year ago, a needle driven by the rain, seeking only shelter from the storm. I was leaving this chapter not as a needle, but as a compass. The storm wasn’t over; the storm was the world. But I had built a boat. I had charted the currents. I had learned to sail.

I turned off the desk lamp, leaving the room in the soft, blue-grey light of the city at night. I didn’t look back at the room. I looked out the window, at the endless, shifting pattern of light and shadow and water, at the great, sleeping beast of the city.

I pulled on my jacket, my fingers brushing the cool metal of the flask in its pocket. A familiar anchor. A reminder of where the waterline was.

I opened the door to the hall and stepped out, not into an ending, but into the perpetual, resonant beginning of the next thing. The corridor stretched before me, leading to the stairs, to the street, to the next door waiting to be pushed open.

I walked toward it, ready.

# Chapter 13

## **Chapter 13**

The invitation from Egel arrived not by post, but by courier. A thick, cream-colored card, the address embossed in a severe, elegant type. It was placed directly into my hand by a young man in a dark coat who waited on the landing until I took it, his expression as blank as a closed door. No words were exchanged. The transaction was complete the moment the paper left his gloved fingers and touched mine.

I carried it inside, to the desk by the window. The city below was a study in muted golds and deep blues, the evening light lying across the rooftops like worn velvet. I did not open it immediately. I let it sit on the scarred wood, a foreign artifact in my familiar space. Its presence was a pressure, a slight but definite shift in the atmosphere of the room, like the arrival of a silent, well-dressed guest.

Finally, I slid a thumb under the flap. The paper gave way with a soft, expensive sigh.

*Mevrouw de Vries,* it began. Not ‘Els’. The formality was the first move. *You are requested for an evening of conversation at the residence of Mijnheer A. Egel, Keizersgracht 724. Eight o’clock. Informal.*

The date was tomorrow. The assumption of availability, the second move. ‘Informal’ was the third, and the most complex. In the world of the *jenever* glass and the zinc counter, informal meant rolled sleeves and loosened collars. Here, it was a code. It meant no tails, no ballgowns, but it did not mean no armor. It meant the knives would be smaller, better concealed, their cuts delivered with a smile.

I placed the card back on the desk. A focused curiosity, that was what I had felt. It remained, but it was now cold, a surgeon’s curiosity. I would go. I would listen. I would learn the language. But first, I had to choose my own uniform for this informal war.

***

The dress was a weapon, and like any good weapon, it was a compromise. I found it in a small, stubborn shop run by a widow whose eyes held the same flinty assessment as my own. It was a deep, smoky grey, the color of the North Sea under a winter sky. The cut was severe, almost masculine in the line of the shoulders, but the fabric was a heavy, fluid silk that moved with a whisper. It covered me from throat to wrist to ankle, yet the way it fell suggested the shape beneath without concession. It was armor, but armor that acknowledged the battlefield. It said: *I see your game. I am playing. But I have not forgotten my own rules.*

The widow, Marta—of course her name was Marta—nodded once as I turned before her mirror. “It needs no jewelry,” she said, her voice like rustling paper. “It would be an insult. Like gilding a rifle.”

I paid her in cash, the notes passing between us with the solemnity of a treaty. She wrapped the dress in tissue, then in plain brown paper. “Good luck,” she said, as I took the parcel. It wasn’t a pleasantry. It was an intelligence report from a veteran of a different, older front.

The night of the invitation, I dressed slowly. The silk was cool against my skin. I did my hair, pinning it back in a way that was neat but not ornate. My face in the mirror was pale, sharp, all angles and watchfulness. I looked like what I was: a creature from a different ecosystem, carefully adapted for a night in a more rarefied atmosphere. I would not blend. I would contrast.

The final touch was the flask. I filled it with the good *jenever*, the one Jan kept under the counter for special occasions, which usually meant funerals or near-death experiences. I slid it into a small, matching grey silk pouch I’d stitched, and tucked it into the hidden pocket within the seam of the dress. An anchor. A reminder of the waterline.

A taxi, summoned by a call from the café phone, took me to the Keizersgracht. The canal houses floated in the darkness, their gabled facades illuminated like stage sets, golden light spilling from enormous windows onto the black water. Number 724 was a giant, a monument to restrained wealth. I paid the driver and stood on the cobbles, looking up. The hum of the city was different here. It was the hum of money, of engines purring inside polished automobiles, of crystal clinking, a higher, more brittle frequency.

The door was opened by a man in a black suit before I could lift the knocker. He was older, his face a mask of professional neutrality. “Mevrouw de Vries,” he said, stepping back. He knew. They all knew. I was expected, my name and likely my biography already circulated among the staff. I was the evening’s novelty.

I crossed the threshold into a silence so profound it felt like a physical substance. The entrance hall was a vault of marble and dark wood, a single, monstrous flower arrangement on a central table screaming color into the stillness. My footsteps were swallowed by an immense Persian carpet. The air smelled of beeswax, old books, and the faint, dry scent of orchids.

“The gathering is in the library,” the man said, gesturing to an arched doorway. “May I take your coat?”

I had no coat. I had only the dress and the hidden flask. “No, thank you,” I said. My voice, used to cutting through the din of De Visser, sounded too loud, too raw in the cushioned quiet. I saw the faintest flicker in his eyes. Another note for his report: *Declines courtesy. Possibly armed.*

I walked toward the arch, the silk whispering a warning with every step.

The library was not a room; it was a landscape. Two stories of books climbed the walls, accessed by a slender, wrought-iron gallery. A fire crackled in a fireplace large enough to roast an ox, and the light from it danced across the faces of a dozen people. They stood in small constellations, holding glasses of wine or whiskey. The conversation was a low, polished murmur.

Every head turned as I entered. The murmur did not stop, but it dipped, recalibrated. I was a new variable in the equation.

Egel detached himself from a group near the fire. He wore a dark suit, no tie, the ‘informality’ on him looking like a statesman’s leisure. “Els,” he said, extending a hand. He used my first name here, in his fortress. A reclamation of territory. “I’m so pleased you could come.”

I took his hand. His grip was firm, dry, assessing. “Mijnheer Egel. Thank you for the invitation.”

“Aad, please. We are informal.” His smile was a professional tool, well-maintained. “Come, let me introduce you.”

The introductions were a masterclass in the new language. He did not say, “This is Els de Vries, she runs a questionable café and solves problems for desperate women.” He said, “This is Mevrouw de Vries. She has an remarkable understanding of our city’s less-charted neighborhoods.” Or, “Mevrouw de Vries possesses a singular practical expertise.”

The men shook my hand, their eyes performing a rapid, professional appraisal—not of my body, but of my potential utility or threat. Their handshakes were brief, their nods precise. The women were different. Their smiles were perfect, their greetings warm, but their eyes held a deeper, more complex calculus. They were experts in this environment, fluent in its subtle hierarchies. They saw the dress, understood its statement, and were determining whether I was a challenger, a curiosity, or a potential ally in their own, unspoken games. One, a woman in her fifties with a face of serene, sharp intelligence and a necklace of raw amber, held my gaze a beat longer. “I’ve heard your name,” she said, her voice soft. “In interesting contexts.”

“I find interesting contexts have a way of finding me, Mevrouw…?”

“Van Dijk.” She smiled, and it reached her eyes. “The feeling is mutual.”

Egel guided me to a sideboard where a man in a white jacket stood behind an array of bottles. “What may I offer you? We have an excellent Bordeaux, or a single malt, if you prefer.”

The *jenever* in my hidden flask called to me, a base note of the real world. But to drink it here would be to raise a flag of otherness, a declaration of separation. To accept their wine was to play their game on their board.

“Whiskey,” I said. “Neat.”

A slight elevation of Egel’s eyebrow. A small point scored, or perhaps ceded. The barman poured two fingers of a tawny gold liquid into a heavy crystal glass. I took it, let the heat of the spirit bloom in the space between my palm and the cool crystal.

For an hour, I sailed. I moved from constellation to constellation, a dark star passing through their ordered heavens. I listened. The talk was of politics, but not the street-level graft I knew; it was of policy, of influence, of the gentle steering of great ships of state and commerce. It was of art acquisitions, of charitable foundations, of zoning laws for the docklands redevelopment. Names were dropped like chess pieces: the Burgemeester, a certain Minister, the head of the Port Authority. I said little. I asked concise questions. I learned that a man’s true opinion was often revealed in what he dismissed, and a woman’s power was often located in the quiet amendment she made to her husband’s statement.

I was circling back toward the fire, a refill of whiskey in my hand—a prop, mostly, its level barely lowered—when I saw him. He stood slightly apart, near the French doors leading to a terrace, studying a globe in a stand. He was younger than most here, perhaps in his late thirties, with a lean, restless frame that seemed uncomfortable in its well-tailored clothes. His hair was a shade too long, his posture lacking the ingrained, relaxed authority of the other men. He turned as I approached, and his eyes were not assessing. They were interested, openly and without guile.

“Contemplating escape?” I asked, nodding toward the terrace and the dark garden beyond.

He smiled, a quick, genuine thing. “Is it that obvious? I find these things… a bit airless.” He gestured with his own glass toward the room. “I’m Simon.”

“Els.”

“I know.” He leaned a shoulder against the bookshelf. “You’re the topic of the week. The mysterious woman from the docks who helped old Martens’ daughter. And who told Aad Egel ‘no’, then ‘maybe’, all in one conversation.”

So the story had traveled, polished and simplified in the telling. “The facts are roughly correct. The mystery is overstated.”

“I doubt that.” He took a drink. “Aad’s fascinated. He collects unique things. People included.”

“And you? What do you collect?”

“Problems,” he said, and the smile turned wry. “I’m a lawyer. A bad one, according to my father.” He nodded toward a tall, silver-haired man holding court by the mantel. “He thinks I should be managing the family holdings, not defending squatters’ rights or fighting the Port Authority on behalf of small fishermen.”

The statement was a grenade rolled casually onto the polished floor. It was a test. I watched it lie there between us. “That sounds like more interesting work,” I said, neutrally.

His eyes lit. “It is. It’s also a fantastic way to become the disappointing son.” He looked at me directly. “You’ve made a space for yourself outside all this. That’s… impressive.”

“It’s necessary,” I corrected. “Spaces don’t exist. They’re taken.”

Before he could reply, Egel was beside us, his timing impeccable. “Simon, monopolizing our guest of honor?” His tone was avuncular, but there was a steel thread in it. “Els, there’s someone I’d like you to meet. A fellow pragmatist.”

Simon gave a slight, almost imperceptible shrug of surrender. “A pleasure, Mevrouw de Vries.”

Egel led me away, his hand a light, proprietary pressure on my elbow. He steered me to a corner where a man stood alone, watching the room with the calm, detached gaze of a sniper. He was compact, bald, his face unreadable.

“Els, this is Maarten Brink. Maarten handles… special logistics for several of our civic projects.”

Brink offered a hand. His grip was crushing, brief, and devoid of any human warmth. It was a functional grip, like operating a lever. “De Vries.” His voice was a low rasp. “Egel speaks highly of your resourcefulness.”

“I solve local problems,” I said.

“So do I.” His eyes were the color of old ice. “On a larger scale. The docklands redevelopment, for instance. A complex problem. Many moving parts. Some of them… resistant.”

The conversation with Simon about fishermen and squatters’ rights echoed in my head. I took a sip of whiskey, let the burn focus me. “Resistance is often a matter of perspective.”

“Perspective can be adjusted,” Brink said evenly. “With the right leverage. Or the right removal of leverage.” He paused, his gaze fixed on me. “I understand you have a talent for finding leverage in unexpected places. That is a valuable talent. Aligning local… stability… with broader progress is crucial.”

It was not a threat. It was colder than that. It was a strategic assessment. He was measuring me, not as a woman or a curiosity, but as a piece on the board. A piece that could be useful, or could become an obstruction to be cleared.

Egel watched us, a benign smile on his face. He had brought me here for this. Not for the wine or the firelight, but for this moment in the corner. To see how I would stand under Brink’s glacial gaze. To see if I understood the game being played on the polished floors.

“Stability is my primary concern,” I said, meeting Brink’s eyes. “The stability of my neighborhood. My people. Progress that shatters that is just a different kind of storm.”

Brink’s lips twitched in something that was not a smile. “Storms pass. The landscape after is what matters.”

The verbal chess match was broken by Van Dijk, the woman with the amber necklace. She slipped her arm through mine with a practiced ease. “Aad, Maarten, you are being dreadfully serious. You’ll frighten her away. Come, Els, I want your opinion on a terrible painting my husband insists on buying.”

She drew me away, her grip firm. When we were out of earshot, near a hideous, gilded landscape, she dropped the social smile. Her voice was low and urgent. “Be careful of Brink. He is not a man. He is a function. A demolition function.”

“Why tell me this?”

“Because you are a new piece on the board,” she said, echoing my own thought. “And the board is tipping. My husband is on the planning committee. Brink’s ‘special logistics’ for the docklands involve clearing the old warehouses—the ones full of artists, and squatters, and those fishermen your new friend Simon is so fond of. Quietly. Efficiently. No messy protests.”

“And Egel?”

“Aad believes in order. A clean, prosperous city. He sees Brink as the broom that sweeps clean. He sees you as someone who understands the dust.” She patted my arm, the social smile returning as a man approached. “Think on it, my dear. The invitation tonight was not to socialize. It was to observe the tools in the shed.”

The evening wound down. Goodbyes were performed, a symphony of insincere warmth and promised future meetings. Egel saw me to the door himself. “I hope it was not too tedious,” he said.

“It was illuminating,” I replied.

“Good. We should talk again soon. About the city. Our shared interests.” He held the door open. The cold night air rushed in, a shocking, welcome relief. “A car is waiting for you.”

I did not argue. The black sedan idled at the curb. I slid into the back seat, the scent of leather and privilege filling my lungs. As the car pulled away from the glowing monument of 724 Keizersgracht, I finally let my breath out, a long, slow stream in the dark.

I had learned the language. I had seen the board. Brink was the threat, a cold force of eradication disguised as progress. Egel was the architect, willing to use any tool. Simon was a potential fracture line, a source of information. Van Dijk was an ally of convenience, a player with her own agenda.

And I was not a piece to be moved. I was a fact. A piece of the landscape they intended to remodel.

The car dropped me at the foot of my own street. I walked the last distance, the cobbles hard and familiar under my thin soles. The hum here was my hum: the distant shout, the bass from a basement bar, the smell of fried dough and wet stone.

Inside my room, I shut the door on the world of crystal and quiet threats. I stripped off the grey silk, hung it carefully. It had served its purpose. In my underclothes, I pulled the flask from its hidden pocket, unscrewed the cap, and took a long, unmediated swallow of *jenever*. The fire of it was truth, was home.

I stood at the window, looking at my city, the real one. The great, sleeping beast. Brink and Egel saw it as a machine to be optimized, a canvas to be whitewashed. They saw the warehouses as blots, the fishermen as rust, the Martas as sentimental clutter.

I saw the beast’s ecosystem. The warehouses were its hollow bones, sheltering life in the marrow. The fishermen were its link to the deep, old blood of the sea. The Martas were its immune system.

They planned a demolition. A clean, efficient removal of leverage.

I felt no anxiety. Only a cold, focused clarity. They had shown me their hand. They believed their game, played on polished floors with unspoken rules, was the only one that mattered.

But I knew a secret. The most dangerous game is not played in a library by a fire. It is played in the streets, in the rain, in the spaces between. It is played by those with nothing to lose but their place in the ecosystem. I had built a boat. I had charted the currents. And I knew how to sail into a storm, or how to create one.

I would not fight their war on their terms. I would not plead or protest.

I would go to the warehouses. I would find the artists, the squatters, the fishermen Simon tried to defend. I would not offer help. I would offer a simple, brutal equation: their problem was my problem. Brink’s “special logistics” relied on fear, on isolation, on picking off the weak one by one.

I would make that impossible. I would weave the disparate, resistant threads of the docklands into a net. A net strong enough to snag the broom that sought to sweep them clean.

I finished the *jenever*, the final warmth a covenant with myself. The invitation had been a door into their world. My response would be a door of my own making, slammed shut in theirs, protecting what was mine.

The city gleamed below, its constellations of light reflected in a thousand dark puddles. The storm wasn’t coming. I was the storm. And I would break where I chose.

## **Chapter 14**

The rain had gentled to a persistent, whispering drizzle by the time I reached the docklands. It was the kind of rain that didn’t fall so much as it seeped, finding every weakness in the asphalt, every crack in the mortar, the very air a cold, damp cloth pressed against the face. The city’s polished heart was miles away, a memory of electric light and silent carpets. Here, the only light was the sickly orange glow of the few streetlamps still functioning, their light swallowed by the fog rolling in off the water. The smell was different, too—not fryer grease and stale beer, but wet rust, rotting wood, and the profound, ancient stink of the river at low tide.

The warehouses loomed like the skeletons of beached whales, their vast, dark shapes hunched against the skyline. Brink and Egel saw blots. I saw topography. I saw the high ground.

My first stop was the one they called the *Bakstenen Reus*—the Brick Giant. It was the largest of the condemned structures, a fortress of crumbling red brick and boarded-up windows. Inside, it was a kingdom of echoes and stolen electricity. The ground floor was a cavernous space, the ceiling lost in shadow, strung with a web of extension cords that fed a constellation of bare bulbs. They illuminated a chaotic, vibrant sprawl: makeshift studios partitioned by stained bedsheets, sculptures welded from scrap metal looming like silent sentinels, the acrid tang of oil paint and turpentine cutting through the damp.

Heads lifted as I entered, a dozen pairs of eyes catching the movement from their canvases and workbenches. The conversation, a low murmur of ideas and complaint, didn’t stop, but it changed pitch. It became a watchful hum. I was an anomaly here, too. Not a stray cat this time, but a bird of prey landing in a dovecote. My coat was too good, my posture too straight. I carried the chill of the outside world in with me.

A man peeled away from a group huddled around a space heater, wiping his hands on paint-stained trousers. He was young, with a sharp, intelligent face and eyes that were older than the rest of him. Raf, I remembered. Simon had pointed him out once, called him the unofficial mayor of the Reus.

“Els,” he said, not a question. His voice was flat, devoid of Jan’s transactional gruffness. This was a different currency. “Heard you were asking around. After what happened to Simon.”

I didn’t nod. I held his gaze, let the silence between us stretch until it became its own kind of answer. “I’m not here to ask,” I said. My voice was quiet, but it carried in the echo chamber of the space. A few more people looked over. “I’m here to tell. The eviction notices on these walls? They’re not the city’s. They’re a private concern. A company called Brink Holdings.”

Raf’s expression didn’t flicker. “We know who owns the paper. It doesn’t change the locks they’ll put on the doors.”

“It does,” I said. I took a step further in, letting the weak light fall on my face. “Because the city follows rules. Slow, stupid, bureaucratic rules. Appeals. Hearings. Delays. Brink doesn’t. He uses ‘special logistics.’ Men who don’t wear uniforms, who work at night. Who make problems disappear before the sun comes up.”

I saw it then, the minute tightening around his eyes. They’d seen it already. A slashed canvas. Tools gone missing. A fire in a trash bin that got a little too close to the bedding area. Nuisance stuff. The kind that breeds a slow, grinding fear.

“What’s your interest?” a woman’s voice cut in. She emerged from behind a large, abstract canvas streaked with furious reds and blacks. Marta. Of course there was a Marta here. Her hair was tied back in a practical knot, her hands raw and chapped. An artist, but her eyes were the same as all the Martas—assessing, pragmatic, rooted in the physical world.

“They made it my interest,” I said, turning to include her. “They tried to buy my silence. My compliance. They showed me their plans. A clean sweep. Art galleries where this stands. Wine bars where the fishermen mend their nets. They don’t see you. They see rust. Sentimental clutter.”

The word *clutter* did what my presence could not. It sparked a low flame in the watchful eyes around me. Insult was a language they understood far better than threat.

“So you come to warn us?” Raf asked, a thread of skepticism woven through his tone. “A civic duty?”

I let out a short, breath that wasn’t a laugh. “I don’t do duty. I do ecosystems. They’re picking you off one by one because you’re alone. The artists here. The squatters in the *Noordelijke Loods*. The old men on the fishing quay. Separate threads. Easy to snap.”

Marta crossed her arms. “And you’re going to weave us together?”

“No,” I said. The simplicity of the word hung in the air. “You’re going to weave yourselves. I’m just giving you the pattern. Their strength is secrecy, speed, fear. Your weakness is isolation. Remove the isolation, and their strength becomes a liability. A man swinging a broom in an empty room is efficient. A man swinging a broom in a room full of tripwires and glue is a fool.”

I reached into my coat, not for a weapon, but for a folded sheaf of papers. Basic schematics of the dockland blocks, drawn from memory and city archives. I laid them on a nearby worktable stained with a rainbow of pigments. “You have lookouts. Use them. Not just for your own door. The quay is your door. The *Loods* is your door. One sees something, a van, men with tools after dark, they don’t hide. They sound an alarm. A specific one. A light pattern. A siren from that old boat horn on the quay. You all hear it, you all respond. Not to fight. To witness. To be a crowd. To take pictures with those phones you charge on stolen current. Brink’s men are ghosts. Flood them with light.”

Raf was studying the map, his finger tracing the lines between warehouses. “A neighborhood watch. For squatters.”

“A net,” I corrected. “A single, irritable organism. You make it too loud, too messy, too *visible* for their special logistics. They rely on you being ashamed, being illegal, being afraid of the proper authorities. Stop being afraid of the authorities. Start making the authorities afraid of the scene *you’ll* create if they let Brink’s cleaners operate.”

Marta was watching me, her head tilted. “This is a war,” she said, not accusingly, but as a statement of fact.

“It’s pest control,” I replied, meeting her eyes. “And you are not the pests.”

There was a longer silence. It was no longer wary, but calculating. I could see the minds working, connecting the dots between their scattered domains. The idea was not charity. It was not solidarity in the bleeding-heart sense. It was tactical, selfish, and brutal. It appealed to them because it was real.

“And you?” Raf asked finally. “Where are you in this net?”

I smiled then, a thin, cold show of teeth. “I’m the one who knows where the broom is stored. And I’m the one who will break its handle.”

I left them with the map, with the idea, a seed planted in fertile, resentful ground. My next stop was the fishing quay, a narrower, smellier kingdom of its own. The men here were older, their resistance not of paint and theory, but of habit and salt-cured stubbornness. They stood in small groups under tarpaulin awnings, mending nets with swift, gnarled fingers, their conversations a series of grunts and observations about the wind.

Their leader was not a leader at all, but the oldest of them, a man named Piet with a face like a weathered cliff and eyes the color of the winter sea. He listened to my same, stripped-down explanation, his hands never stopping their rhythmic work with the net needle.

When I finished, he spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dark water lapping at the pilings. “Crowds. Lights. Nonsense. When they come, a crowbar is a better argument.”

“A crowbar gets you arrested,” I said, leaning against a moss-slick bollard. “A crowd of fifty people with cameras gets you on the evening news. Which one costs Brink more?”

Piet’s needle paused for a fraction of a second. His calculus was different. It wasn’t about art or principle. It was about cost. Annoyance. “My grandson,” he said, nodding toward a sullen young man scaling fish with violent efficiency. “He has one of those phones. Always filming nonsense.”

“Good,” I said. “Let him film. The world loves an old fisherman getting pushed around by men in black jackets. It’s a better story than a new wine bar.”

A grim, toothless approximation of a smile touched Piet’s mouth. “Aye. We’re picturesque, until we’re in the way.” He looked out at the river, at the fog swallowing the opposite bank. “The alarm. The boat horn. We can do that. For Simon.”

It wasn’t agreement out of strategy. It was a debt, paid in vigilance. It was stronger.

By the time I approached the *Noordelijke Loods*, the night had deepened. This warehouse was the most derelict, home not to artists but to those who had simply run out of everywhere else to go. The air smelled of damp concrete, unwashed bodies, and the sweet-sour tang of desperation. Here, the fear was a living thing, a cold draft that coiled around the ankles.

I was met not by a spokesperson, but by a wall of silent, hostile stares from the shadows. A woman eventually stepped forward, wrapped in a blanket, her hair a wild tangle. She didn’t ask my name. “You bring trouble or food?”

“Information,” I said, keeping my hands visible. “The trouble is already coming. The information might blunt it.”

I gave the same speech, stripped even barer. No talk of ecosystems or art. Just cause and effect. *Men will come to burn you out. Together with the others, you can make it too difficult. You can make them choose a softer target.*

“Why would the artists care about us?” someone muttered from the darkness.

“They wouldn’t,” I said, my voice cutting through the gloom. “And you wouldn’t care about them. But you both care about not being thrown into the rain. That’s the only thread you need. Hold onto it.”

The woman in the blanket studied me. Her eyes were exhausted, but not stupid. “You’re the one from the bar. The one who knew Simon.”

“Yes.”

She nodded, once. “We listen for the horn.”

It was done. The connections were made, not with friendship, but with the brittle, functional glue of shared threat. I had turned the docklands from a collection of targets into a single, prickly hide. Walking back through the drizzle, I felt the cold, focused clarity solidify into something harder. A plan. A weapon I had forged from the very resentment Brink had sought to exploit.

I didn’t go home. I went to De Visser. The warmth was a familiar slap, the murmur a familiar soundtrack. Jan saw my face and poured the *jenever* without a word. I took the glass, the first real heat of the day spreading from my gut to my frozen fingers.

I had set the stage. Now I needed the players. Brink’s “special logistics” would be a team, likely subcontracted, men who traded violence for cash and discretion. They would have a base, a van, a routine. I needed to find it. To see their faces. To know the broom before it started to swing.

The door to the bar opened, letting in a gust of wet, cold air. A man entered, shaking water from his dark wool coat. He wasn’t a regular. His shoes were too clean, his frame too broad beneath the tailored fabric. He didn’t look around with the curiosity of a stranger, but with the scanning assessment of someone checking a perimeter.

He walked to the bar, two stools down from me, and ordered a beer. His voice was low, accentless. He paid with exact change. He didn’t drink, just turned the bottle slowly on the zinc, watching the condensation make a wet ring.

He was a professional. And he was here, in this bar at the edge of the docklands, on this particular night.

My pulse, which had been a slow, cold metronome, didn’t quicken. It deepened. Became a heavier, more deliberate thud. I took a slow sip of my *jenever*, letting the heat bloom on my tongue.

They weren’t waiting for the eviction date. They were doing reconnaissance. Softening the ground. Perhaps they’d heard a whisper that the disparate threads were stirring.

The man’s eyes, reflected in the smudged mirror behind the bar, slid over the room and, for a fraction of a second, met mine. There was no recognition in them. Only a flat, empty evaluation. A cataloging of assets and obstacles. To him, I was just a woman in a bar, of no more consequence than the stool she sat on.

He finished his beer, left the bottle precisely centered on its ring of moisture, and walked back out into the rain.

I counted to thirty. Then I laid coins on the bar, a silent transaction Jan acknowledged with a blink.

Outside, the drizzle had turned back into a needling rain. The street was empty, but the taillights of a dark sedan were just disappearing around the distant corner, heading not toward the city’s bright center, but deeper into the industrial gloom, toward the river’s most forgotten bend.

A location. A direction.

The net was strung. The broom was on the move.

And I knew where it was going to sleep tonight.

# Chapter 15

## **Chapter 15**

The river’s forgotten bend was a graveyard of ambition. Hulks of old cranes stood against the bruised sky like the skeletons of giant, arthritic birds. Warehouses, their windows boarded or gaping, slumped against one another for support. The rain here was different. It didn’t fall from the sky so much as it seeped from the bricks, dripped from rusted iron, pooled in the cracked concrete underfoot—a cold, persistent exhalation of the place itself.

I kept to the shadows where they were deep, moved through the patches of sickly yellow light from the few working streetlamps where they were not. My coat was a sodden weight. The *jenever*’s warmth was a memory in my veins, replaced by a sharp, clean clarity. The dark sedan was parked, empty, outside a two-story brick building that might have once been a customs office. A faint, rhythmic glow came from a second-floor window—the sweep of a flashlight beam.

They were inside. Doing their inventory.

I circled the block, my boots making no sound in the oily grit. The building’s back was a cliff-face of brick, scarred by the ghost-lines of torn-down fire escapes. A single metal door, banded with iron, was set into the wall. A heavy padlock hung from the hasp, but the hasp itself was new, the screws bright against the corroded steel of the door. A recent upgrade. I ran a gloved finger along the jamb. Fine, almost invisible scratches radiated from the lock. Picked, and not long ago.

They hadn’t bothered to re-lock it behind them. Arrogance, or a belief that no one would be fool enough to follow them into this wet, dark throat of the city.

I was that fool. I eased the door open, a sliver of darkness yielding to a deeper darkness within. The smell was immediate: damp rot, pigeon droppings, and beneath it, the faint, coppery scent of old rust. And something else. A dry, papery smell. Books.

The ground floor was a cavern, empty save for mounds of debris and the pale, watching shapes of discarded machinery shrouded in plastic. A set of wooden stairs against the far wall led up. The flashlight beam strobed again from above, painting the ceiling with fleeting, geometric shadows. Voices, muffled by distance and the drumming of rain on the roof, filtered down. Two of them. A low, methodical exchange.

I took the stairs one at a time, placing my weight along the outer edge where the wood was less likely to groan. The clarity in my head narrowed to a tunnel: the next step, the next breath, the next sliver of light from above.

The upper floor was a long, open space, once an office, now a shell. Partitions had been torn out, leaving a forest of electrical conduits and pipe stubs protruding from the floor. At the far end, in a pool of light from two powerful electric lanterns set on the floor, the two men worked.

The one from the bar—broad, tailored—was scanning the spines of books stacked in precarious towers against the wall. He handled each volume with a peculiar, surgical care, using the blade of a small knife to gently separate pages, peering into the gutters. The other man was younger, leaner, with a restless energy. He was prying up sections of the wide-plank floor with a crowbar, his movements efficient, violent. The dry, papery smell was stronger here, mixed with the scent of raw, wet earth rising from the subfloor.

This was the cache. Not a single document, but a library. A history. The physical proof of every deal, every name, every whispered promise that had built the Syndicate’s power in this city. And the man with the knife wasn’t just checking for hidden compartments. He was assessing, selecting. He would take the core, the most damning ledgers. The rest—the context, the minor players, the full story—would be left behind for the city’s bulldozers, or for a carefully set fire once the demolition crews moved in.

The broom wasn’t just sweeping. It was editing.

The younger man grunted, levering up a longer board. “Nothing under this section. Just dirt and rats.”

“Keep looking,” the older man said, his voice the same flat, accentless instrument I’d heard in the bar. “The map indicated a secondary cavity. Three feet from the north wall, eight feet from the west.”

“The map’s a century old. The walls have shifted.”

“The walls haven’t shifted. Your measurements are sloppy.”

A flicker of irritation crossed the younger man’s face, a crack in the professional veneer. He didn’t like being corrected. He was muscle, but he fancied himself a technician. A dangerous combination.

I melted back into the deeper darkness near the stairhead, behind a thick, cast-iron heating column. My pulse was that heavy, deliberate thud again. I was not an obstacle to them. I was a ghost. I could slip back down the stairs, back into the rain, and they would never know. The direction was confirmed. The net was here. But knowing the shape of the trap wasn’t the same as springing it. To stop them, I’d have to become an obstacle. And two professional men, one irritated, both armed, would not see a woman in the dark as a person. They would see a problem to be solved. Permanently.

The younger man slammed the crowbar down. “It’s not here. We’ve been at this for two hours. We have the primary ledgers. Burn the rest and be done with it.”

The older man didn’t look up from the folio he was examining. “We follow the protocol. The secondary cache contains the beneficiary registries. The names behind the names. Without them, this is just accounting. With them, it is a weapon. Find it.”

The beneficiary registries. The true currency of the Syndicate. Not just who owed, but who was owed. The politicians, the judges, the police commissioners whose loyalty was purchased not with fear, but with silent, compounding interest. It was the key to the kingdom, or its destruction.

The younger man swore, low and vicious, and drove the crowbar’s claw into the floor again. This time, the wood gave with a different sound—not a splintering crack, but a hollow, echoing groan. He froze. The older man looked up, his flashlight beam joining his partner’s on the floor.

There, in the jagged hole, was not dirt, but the dull gleam of metal. A long, flat box.

A slow, satisfied smile spread across the older man’s face. It was the most chilling expression I’d seen yet. “There. Gently now.”

I watched as they lifted the box, a sealed tin case the length of a rifle, out of the floor. It was heavy. The younger man carried it to a cleared space near the lanterns and set it down with a soft thud. The older man produced a set of lock picks from an inner pocket and went to work on the simple clasp. His hands were steady, precise.

This was the moment. The core of the core was being exposed. Once it was in their hands, in that sedan, it would vanish into a vault or an incinerator, and the city’s memory would be surgically removed.

I stepped out from behind the column.

The sound of my foot settling on the gritty floor was soft, but in the tense, silent focus of the room, it was a gunshot. Both men went perfectly still. Then, as one, they turned. The younger man’s hand went to his waist. The older man simply straightened up, his picks still in the lock, and looked at me.

His eyes held the same flat evaluation they had in the bar’s mirror. But now there was a flicker—not of alarm, but of recalculations. I was no longer part of the scenery. I had inserted myself into the equation.

“This is a restricted area,” he said, his voice devoid of any inflection that could be construed as a question.

I said nothing. I let the silence stretch, let the rain on the roof fill it. I took another step forward, into the fringe of the lantern light. Let him see the damp wool coat, the wet hair plastered to my skull, the empty hands.

The younger man drew his weapon, a compact, black automatic. He didn’t point it at me, not yet. He held it down by his thigh, his body coiled. “Who are you?”

The older man sighed, a faint exhalation of disappointment. “She’s no one. A squatter. A addict looking for a dry place.” His eyes never left mine. “Aren’t you?”

It was a test. A dismissal. A woman alone in this place could only be those things. To be anything else violated the natural order he understood.

“You’re taking what isn’t yours,” I said. My voice was rough from disuse and the cold, but it didn’t waver.

The younger man barked a laugh. “Listen to her. It isn’t ours? And it’s yours?”

“It belongs to the city,” I said. “To the people who bled for it.”

The older man’s lip curled. He finally took his picks from the lock. “Sentimentality. The most useless currency of all.” He nodded to his partner. “Remove her. Quietly.”

The younger man moved forward, confident now. I was a nuisance to be cleared. He holstered his weapon, deciding hands were enough. He was bigger, younger, stronger. The logic was immutable.

As he reached for me, his hand aiming to clamp on my upper arm and spin me toward the stairs, I didn’t pull away. I stepped into him. My left hand came up, not to block his grab, but to guide it past me, while my right drove stiffened fingers into the soft hollow at the base of his throat. It was not a fight-ending blow. It was a punctuation. A shocking, breath-stealing full stop in the narrative he was writing.

He gagged, his eyes bulging, and stumbled back a step. The surprise on his face was absolute. I didn’t press the advantage. I simply stood my ground, my hands falling back to my sides.

The older man’s flat gaze sharpened. The calculation in his eyes sped up. “I see,” he murmured. He didn’t tell his partner to get up. He assessed me anew. The sodden coat, the quiet stance, the precise, economical violence. The puzzle pieces were not fitting the picture he had pre-cut.

“You are not a squatter,” he stated.

“No.”

“You followed me from De Visser.”

“Yes.”

“You work for one of the remnant families. Seeking leverage. Or revenge.” He tilted his head. “A woman. They must be truly desperate.”

He was building a new box to put me in. It was still the wrong one, but it was more dangerous. I was now a known, if minor, adversary. An asset of a defeated foe.

“I work for no one,” I said.

“Everyone works for someone.” He took a slow step to the side, placing himself between me and the tin case. His right hand drifted toward his own coat. “Even ghosts have to eat.”

The younger man had recovered his breath, his face mottled with rage and humiliation. He drew his weapon again, this time leveling it at my chest. “Enough of this. I’ll put her down, and we can finish.”

“No,” the older man said, his voice a whip-crack. The younger man flinched. “She is not a stray dog. She is a message. Sent here. To be seen.” His eyes drilled into me. “Who sent you? Van Houten? The widow Aarden? Tell me, and your death will be quick. A professional courtesy.”

He believed this was a power play. A dying faction’s pathetic attempt to show they still had teeth, even if it was just a stray set they’d found in an alley. My solitude, my gender, made any other explanation inconceivable. I was a symbol, not an actor.

I used it. I let a slow, cold smile touch my lips—a show of teeth in the currency he understood. “You’re afraid of the wrong people.”

It was the perfect spark. The younger man, his pride still bleeding, saw the smile as a final insult. He shifted his weight, his finger tightening on the trigger. “Fuck this.”

He fired.

The report was deafening in the enclosed space. But I was already moving, not away, but toward the older man, using his body as a shield. The bullet meant for me tore through the older man’s shoulder. He cried out, a short, sharp sound of pure shock, and spun from the impact.

Chaos, true and absolute, erupted.

The younger man stared, horrified, at what he had done. The older man was down on one knee, his good hand clutching his ruined shoulder, blood welling dark between his fingers. His flat eyes were wide with pain and a dawning, volcanic fury. “You idiot!” he snarled.

The younger man swung the gun back toward me, but the moment was gone. His certainty was shattered. I kicked one of the electric lanterns. It skittered across the floor, its beam cartwheeling madly, throwing lunatic shadows, and slammed into the younger man’s shins. He stumbled.

I didn’t go for him. I went for the case.

My hand closed around the cold handle. It was heavier than I expected. The older man, from his knees, made a grab for my ankle. I kicked back, my heel connecting with his wounded shoulder. He gasped, his grip failing.

I ran. Not for the stairs—the younger man was between me and them—but for the far end of the room, where the gaping windows looked out over the river.

“Shoot her!” the older man roared, his voice ragged. “Shoot her now!”

The younger man fired again, twice. Bullets whined past me, punching into brick and timber. One shattered the remaining pane of glass in the window I was heading for. The night air, cold and wet, rushed in.

I didn’t look back. I hurled the tin case through the jagged opening. It vanished into the darkness. Then I followed it.

There was no fire escape, no ledge. Just a two-story drop into blackness and the slick, angled roof of a lower annex. I hit it feet first, the impact driving the air from my lungs, and slid down the wet tiles in a cascade of broken moss and debris. I landed in a heap on a mound of soggy cardboard and refuse in a narrow alley.

Pain bloomed in my ankle, my side. I ignored it, scrambling to my feet, my eyes searching the darkness. The tin case lay a few feet away, dented but intact.

Above, a flashlight beam stabbed out of the broken window, sweeping the alley. A voice, furious, echoed down. “Find her! Find that case!”

I grabbed the handle and ran, limping, into the labyrinth of the river bend. The net was torn. The broom was bleeding. And I had stolen its teeth.

But as I vanished into the dripping darkness, the older man’s words echoed in the hammering of my heart and the throbbing in my ankle. *She is a message.*

He was wrong. I was not a message.

But the gunshots in the night were. And they would be heard. By the wrong people. By the right people. By everyone. The silent, surgical excision was over. Now it was a war. And I had just lit the fuse in the one hand that could not afford to hold it.

# Chapter 16

## **Chapter 16**

The river bend was a wound in the city’s flesh, a place where the old stone wept a constant, greasy damp. I moved through its arteries, my breath a ragged saw in my throat, the tin case a dead weight that pulled at my shoulder with every limping step. The ankle was a hot, tight knot above my boot. Not broken. Sprained. A luxury of pain I could not afford.

I did not head for my own rooms. That path was a known quantity, a line they would draw the moment they had the breath to draw it. Instead, I turned deeper into the maze, towards the places that even the rats considered a downgrade. The buildings here leaned against each other for support, their upper stories kissing over the narrow passages, blocking out what little light the cloud-choked moon offered. The ground underfoot was a slick paste of mud and things better not identified.

A message. The words were a cold stone in my gut, heavier than the case. He had not meant a message for me. He had meant I was a message *from* someone. A statement written in blood and bullets, delivered to the doorstep of the men in that warehouse. But from who? And to what end?

The only answer was the metallic taste of fear in my mouth and the throbbing echo of the gunshots. They would be hunting now. Not just the two men—the younger one with the efficient eyes, the older one with the voice of command—but others. The net was not just torn; it was enraged. A wounded animal is more dangerous than a whole one. It does not care for its own skin.

I found a recessed doorway, the wood swollen and rotten, and pressed myself into its shadow. I set the case down between my feet and listened. The city’s night sounds filtered down: the distant clang of a tram, a shout from a street over, the eternal whisper of the river. Beneath it, the closer sounds: the scuttle in the garbage, the drip of water from a broken gutter. No boots. No hushed, urgent voices.

Yet.

I looked at the case. It was a cheap thing, dented from its fall, the green paint scarred to reveal dull metal beneath. A simple clasp, no lock. The teeth of the broom. I knelt, the movement sending a fresh lance of pain up my leg, and worked the clasp. It was stiff, corroded. It gave with a reluctant screech that seemed to echo off the wet bricks.

Inside, nestled in fitted slots of faded velvet, were six syringes. They were not medical. They were heavy-gauge glass, thick-walled, with plungers of polished brass. Each was filled with a clear, viscous fluid. No labels. No markings. Beside them, lying in a separate channel, was a sheaf of papers, folded tight and sealed with a blob of red wax stamped with a symbol I did not recognize—a stylized ‘V’ intertwined with a caduceus.

I did not touch the syringes. I pried the papers free, breaking the seal with my thumbnail. The wax crumbled like old blood. I unfolded them, angling the page to catch the faint ambient glow from a distant streetlamp.

They were shipping manifests. Lists. In a neat, bureaucratic hand. Dates. Times. Dock numbers. Ship names. And names of men. Some I knew. Middlemen. Stevedore foremen. Two city aldermen. And at the bottom of each page, a signature. A florid, arrogant scrawl I knew too well: *Van Houten*.

The blood in my veins went still. Van Houten was not just a name. He was an institution. A man who sat on charitable boards and dined with the chief of police. His warehouses lined the commercial docks, legitimate fronts for God knew what. And here was his hand, directing the flow of these unmarked syringes through the city’s port like so much grain or timber.

A medicine? A poison? A new kind of fear, distilled into glass?

The syringes glinted dully in the dark. They were not a weapon. They were a currency. A promise. Or a threat. The kind of thing you use to buy silence, to ensure loyalty, to break a will without leaving a mark. The kind of thing a man like Van Houten would use to sweep a problem clean away. A surgical excision.

But the surgery had gone wrong. The patient had fought back. And I had stolen the scalpel.

I refolded the papers, my fingers clumsy with cold and something deeper, a dread that was settling into my bones. I slipped them into my inner coat pocket, against my ribs. The syringes I left in their case. I closed the lid. The clasp clicked shut, a final, hollow sound.

I could not run far with the ankle. I needed a hole. A temporary burrow. There was only one person in this bend who owed me a favor that wasn’t measured in coin. A debt of a different kind.

Marta.

She ran a *kroeg* even smaller and fouler than De Visser, a place where the air was solid with the smell of boiled tripe and despair. It was a woman’s place, mostly. The wives and daughters and worn-out mistresses of the men who drank at Jan’s. They came to Marta for a glass of something sharp, for a listening ear that asked no questions, for a back room where a person could disappear for a few hours. Or a few days.

I had once found Marta’s son, Pieter, not ten years old, being used as a runner by a pill-peddler from the eastern docks. I had not done it for her. I had done it because the sight of the boy’s thin, frightened face in that gutter had been a reflection I could not abide. But Marta had called it a debt. “One day,” she’d said, her eyes hard as flint. “You will need a door that is not watched. That day, you come to me.”

Today was that day.

I hefted the case and pushed off from the doorway. The pain was a constant companion now, a rhythm to match my limping gait. I kept to the deepest shadows, my senses stretched taut, listening for the tell-tale rhythm of a pursuit that did not belong here. Twice I froze, pressing into alcoves, as figures passed the mouth of an alley. Once a pair of drunkards, weaving and singing. Once a lone watchman, his footsteps slow and bored. Neither were hunters.

Marta’s place was in the basement of a collapsed tannery, marked only by a faded blue door below street level. A single, flyblown bulb glowed above it. I took the steps down slowly, each one a jolt. I did not knock. I turned the handle and pushed inside.

The warmth here was different from De Visser. It was closer, denser, smelling of cheap perfume, stewed tea, and unwashed hair. The low ceiling was stained brown from smoke. A handful of women sat at small tables, their postures weary, their conversations hushed. They looked up as I entered. Their eyes were not hostile, but they were not welcoming. They were the eyes of creatures who knew the value of shadows and the danger of new things.

Marta stood behind a makeshift bar—a plank laid across two barrels. She was a thin woman, all sharp angles and tight, grey bun, her face a roadmap of hard living. She was polishing a glass with a cloth that was no cleaner than the glass. She did not look up.

“We’re closed,” she said, her voice a dry rustle.

“It’s Els.”

Her polishing stopped. She looked up. Her eyes, a pale, watery blue, took me in: the mud, the torn coat, the obvious favor my ankle was doing me, the tin case. She did not ask. She gave a short, sharp nod towards a curtain of stained sacking at the back of the room.

“Pieter,” she called, not raising her voice. A boy, now thirteen and all elbows and knees, appeared from behind the curtain. “Watch the bar. No credit. Not even for breath.”

The boy nodded, his eyes wide as he looked at me. I followed Marta through the sacking into a small, square room. It held a cot, a chair, a small stove with a kettle on it, and a pervasive smell of camphor. She pointed to the cot.

“Sit.”

I sat. The relief of taking weight off the ankle was so profound it was almost a pain in itself. I set the case on the floor beside me.

Marta busied herself with the kettle, lighting the stove with a match. “The ankle?”

“Sprained.”

“You’ll live.” She rummaged in a cupboard, pulled out a bottle of clear liquid and a roll of yellowed linen. “The rest?”

“Bullets. They missed.”

She poured a generous measure of the liquid—it smelled of anise and fire—into a tin mug and handed it to me. “Drink. For the shock.” Then she knelt, without ceremony, and began to unlace my boot. Her hands were surprisingly gentle. She peeled the boot and sock off, her lips pursing at the sight of the swollen, discolored joint. She poured some of the liquor onto the cloth and began to bind the ankle, tight and expert.

“Who?” she asked, not looking up.

“Men in a warehouse by the commercial docks. They work for Van Houten.”

Her hands stilled for a fraction of a second. Then she continued winding the bandage. “Van Houten. You stick your hand into a high nest, girl.”

“They stuck it in for me. I just pulled back hard.”

“And took something with you.” Her eyes flicked to the case.

I said nothing. The liquor was burning a path to my stomach, spreading a false warmth. Marta finished the bandage, tied it off, and sat back on her heels. She looked at me, really looked, her gaze stripping away the mud and the bravado.

“You are trouble,” she stated. Not an accusation. A fact, like the weather. “The kind that brings other trouble to my door.”

“I need until dawn. Then I’m gone.”

“And then? They will be looking for a limping woman with a tin case. Every pair of eyes on the river will have a price on them by morning.” She stood, brushing her hands on her apron. “You leave the case. You leave the coat. You become someone else for a few hours.”

“I can’t leave the case.”

“Then you are a dead woman walking, and you will die in someone else’s house. My debt is for a door, not a coffin.” Her voice was flat. “What is in it that is worth your life?”

I thought of the syringes. The manifests. Van Houten’s signature. “Proof,” I said, the word tasting bitter. “Of something I don’t yet understand.”

Marta sighed, a sound of profound weariness. “Understanding is a luxury for people with safe beds.” She walked to a trunk in the corner, opened it, and pulled out a dress. It was a drab, grey thing, coarse-woven, the uniform of a charwoman or a factory girl. She tossed it to me. “Put this on. Your coat goes in the stove. The case goes under the cot. You will stay here, in this room. You will be Marta’s cousin, Griet, from the country, here to help clean. You have a bad foot. You say nothing unless spoken to, and then you mumble. You understand?”

I looked from the dress to her implacable face. She was right. To move as I was, was to paint a target on my back. I had to become invisible. I had to become no one.

I nodded.

“Good.” She turned to leave. “I will bring food. And news, if there is any. The walls in the bend have ears, but they also have mouths.”

She slipped back through the sacking curtain, leaving me alone.

I stripped off my coat, my fingers lingering on the pocket where the manifests lay. I transferred them to the waistband of my trousers. Then I fed my coat, piece by piece, into the hungry little stove. The wool smoldered, then caught, the smell of damp and fryer grease giving way to acrid smoke. I watched it burn. It felt like watching a skin being shed.

I put on the dress. It was rough against my skin, smelling of lye and a stranger’s sweat. It hung on me, shapeless and anonymous. I bundled my own clothes and shoved them under the cot with the case. I sat back down. I was Griet. A girl with a bad foot. A nobody.

The act of stillness was a new kind of agony. My mind raced, circling the warehouse, the gunshots, the older man’s words. *She is a message.* A message to Van Houten? A declaration that his quiet, surgical game was discovered? Or a message *from* Van Houten, a warning to someone else that had gone awry, with me as the unintended courier?

The syringes. They were the key. A product. Something to be shipped, distributed. Bought and sold. Or administered.

Marta returned with a bowl of thin stew and a hunk of black bread. She set it on the chair. “Eat.” She stood, listening to the murmur from the outer room. “They are talking. The word is on the water. There was a shooting at the old Van Houten warehouse on the commercial dock. Two men injured. A woman seen fleeing. The city watch is asking questions, but quietly. Too quietly. Van Houten’s men are asking louder. They are offering guilders for information. A lot of guilders.”

“What are they saying about the woman?”

“That she is a thief. That she took something valuable. They are not saying what.” Her eyes narrowed. “But they are saying she is dangerous. Armed. A known associate of… unsavory elements.”

A laugh, harsh and dry, escaped my throat. “They’re building the gallows before they’ve caught the fox.”

“They are telling a story,” Marta corrected, her voice low. “And in their story, you are the villain. This makes things simple for everyone. The watch can look busy. Van Houten can get his property back. And the woman… the woman can be found floating in the river, a tragic end to a life of crime. A closed case.” She looked at the bowl. “Eat, Griet. You will need your strength.”

She left again. I forced the stew down. It was tasteless, but it was hot. The simple act of eating, of being still, of wearing another woman’s skin, began to dull the sharp edge of panic. It was replaced by a cold, focused clarity.

I was in a box. The only way out was to change the story.

To do that, I needed to know what the syringes were. And I needed to tell my story to someone who could not afford to let Van Houten’s story stand.

Jan. At De Visser. He was a neutral ground, a repository of secrets. He heard everything. And he had his own codes, his own loyalties that sometimes ran counter to the men with florid signatures. He was also the only link I had to the man who had started all this—the client who had hired me to find the missing girl, the case that had led me to the warehouse. A client who had given me a name that now felt like a set-up: *De Vries*. A name that had led me to a warehouse full of Van Houten’s men.

I needed to know if Jan had set the snare, or if he was just another piece on the board.

But to get to Jan, I had to get out of the river bend. And to do that, I had to move before the hunt solidified at dawn.

I waited an hour. The murmur in the outer room died down. The single bulb beyond the sacking went out. Silence settled, broken only by the drip of the gutter and the occasional creak of the old building. I pulled my own clothes from under the cot. They were still damp, but they were mine. I changed back into them, the familiar weight a small comfort. I kept the bandage on my ankle. I retrieved the case.

I pushed through the sacking curtain. The main room was dark, empty except for Pieter, asleep on a pallet behind the bar. Marta sat at a table by the dead stove, a single candle guttering beside her. She was not asleep. She was waiting.

“I’m going,” I said, my voice a whisper in the dark.

“I know.” She did not look at me. “The debt is paid.”

“It is.”

“There is a way. Through the old tannery vats. It comes out in the sewer tunnel under Brouwersstraat. It is not pleasant. But it is not watched.”

I nodded. “Thank you, Marta.”

“Do not thank me. Just go. And if you are caught, you found that way yourself. You are a thief. I am a widow who runs a poor *kroeg*. We have never met.”

It was the only kindness left she could offer. I took it.

She led me through a low arch behind the bar, into a space that smelled of earth and ancient, rotten chemicals. She pointed to a rusted iron hatch in the floor, half-hidden by sacks. “Down. Follow the tunnel. It slopes up. The grate at the end is loose.”

I lifted the hatch. A smell of stagnation and decay rose up, thick enough to taste. I looked back at Marta. Her face in the candlelight was a stone mask.

I descended into the blackness.

The tunnel was a tube of slick brick, barely wide enough for my shoulders. I had to hunch, the case scraping against the wall. The darkness was absolute, a physical pressure. I moved by feel, one hand on the cold, wet wall, my bad foot dragging. The sound of my own breathing was deafening. Time lost meaning. There was only the slow, painful shuffle forward, the occasional skitter of something in the muck underfoot, and the crushing weight of the earth above.

Just as the air began to feel slightly less foul, a faint, grey light appeared ahead. The tunnel ended in a vertical shaft, with iron rungs set into the wall. Above, a circular grate. Street light filtered down, diluted by fog. I climbed, each rung a trial for my ankle. I pushed at the grate. It shifted, then gave with a screech of rust.

I emerged into a narrow service alley behind the breweries on Brouwersstraat. The smell of hops and yeast was a sweet relief after the tunnel. It was the dead hour, just before the first stirrings of the city’s morning. The sky was a deep, bruised grey.

I was on the wrong side of the river bend, closer to the commercial district. De Visser was a twenty-minute walk for a healthy person. For me, it would be an hour of agony and exposure.

I had no choice. I pulled my collar up, gripped the case, and began to walk.

The city in this hour was a ghost of itself. Delivery carts began to clatter over cobbles. A lone barge hooted on the river. Lights came on in upper-story windows. I kept my head down, my pace steady, my limp a part of my disguise—just another worker heading for an early shift. I avoided the main thoroughfares, sticking to the service lanes and back streets. Twice I saw pairs of city watchmen, but they were hunched against the damp, their minds on their own discomfort, not on a lone, limping woman.

As I neared the old district where De Visser sat, the character of the streets changed. The buildings grew more cramped, the smells more familiar. I was getting close. And so was the danger.

I turned the corner onto the canal where De Visser stood. The usual yellow glow from its windows was absent. The door was closed. It was too early, even for Jan’s early clients.

I approached from the opposite side of the canal, using the bridge for cover. I watched the door. Nothing moved. The whole street was quiet, sleeping off the night.

It was too quiet.

A prickle, the old instinct, ran up my spine. The silence had a quality to it. A held breath. I looked at the windows above the bar. Jan’s living quarters. Dark.

My eyes scanned the street. A delivery van parked too neatly opposite. The curtain in a first-floor window across the way, drawn but twitching. A man leaning in a doorway down the street, pretending to read a newspaper in the pre-dawn gloom.

They were here. They had anticipated me. They had drawn a circle around the only hole I had left.

Jan was either inside, a prisoner, or he was part of the circle. Either way, De Visser was a trap.

I stood frozen on the bridge, the case heavy in my hand. The sky was lightening from grey to a sickly yellow. The net was here. It had been re-knit, stronger than before. And I was standing in the open, holding the very thing it was designed to catch.

I had no hole left. No alias. No door.

The man in the doorway folded his newspaper. He looked up. His eyes met mine across the distance.

He knew.

I turned and limped, as fast as I could, back the way I had come. Behind me, I heard a low whistle. Then the sound of boots on cobbles, starting at a walk, then breaking into a run.

The hunt was no longer quiet. It was here. It was now. And it had my scent.

# Chapter 17

## **Chapter 17**

The run was a jagged, lurching thing. My leg was a column of hot gravel, each impact sending a fresh shock up into my hip. The case slapped against my thigh, a stupid, clumsy weight. The sound of boots behind me was a spreading stain on the quiet street, not a single set but multiple, converging. They had been waiting in a ring. I had walked into the centre of it, a mouse sniffing at the cheese.

I didn’t look back. Looking back was for prey that had time for regret. I cut left into an alley so narrow my shoulders brushed the damp brick on either side. It was a gutter, not a street, choked with the reek of rotting vegetables and urine. The boots echoed at the mouth, then slowed. They wouldn’t come in single file. They’d send two, hold the rest at the ends. Professional.

Ahead, the alley T-junctioned. Right led back towards the wider canals, towards light and more of them. Left dove deeper into the old quarter, a labyrinth of leaning houses and enclosed courtyards. I went left, my breath sawing in my throat. The sky above the rooftops was the colour of a bruise, yellow at the edges, purple at the heart.

I heard a shout, answered from a parallel street. They were communicating, tightening the cordon. They weren’t chasing. They were herding.

The thought was a cold stone in my gut. I was moving, but I wasn’t choosing. My path was being shaped by their presence, funneled. I needed a door. A crack. Something they hadn’t bought or boarded up.

I burst out of the alley into a small courtyard, a forgotten space between three tall gables. A single gas lamp flickered, useless in the gathering dawn. A woman was drawing water from a shared pump, her back to me. She turned at the sound of my footsteps, her eyes widening at the sight of me—a wild thing, bleeding panic. She didn’t scream. She just took a slow step back, her grip tightening on the handle of her bucket. A judgement passed in that silence: I was trouble. Women’s trouble. The kind that drew the eyes of men with boots and whistles. Her face closed, a shutter slamming down. She would not help. She would point, later, when they asked.

There was a low archway across the court. I made for it. As I passed the pump, I saw my reflection in the dark water of her bucket—a pale, sharp mask, hair plastered to my skull, eyes like holes. No wonder she stepped back.

The archway led to a covered passage, then out onto another canal. Not my canal. A quieter, poorer one. The houses here had wooden galleries stacked above the water, laundry hanging limp in the damp air. I pressed myself into a doorway, the wood rough and splintered against my back. I listened.

Boots, to the north. A steady, walking pace. To the south, silence, but it was the wrong kind of silence. The birds had stopped. I was in a pocket. The net was drawing closed.

I looked at the case in my hand. The stupid, damned case. It was the key to the lock, and the lock was my own neck. I had two choices: drop it, or keep it. Dropping it might make me less interesting. But they had seen me with it. They knew I valued it. A woman running empty-handed was just a woman running. A woman clutching a thing, a prize, was a story. They would want the story. They would peel it from me.

So I kept it.

My eyes scanned the opposite side of the canal. The galleries. A memory, old and dusty, surfaced. Years back, a job for a ship’s chandler who liked to beat his wife. She’d paid me in information, not coin, her voice a whisper in a tavern even rougher than De Visser. She’d mentioned a place, a bolt-hole used by girls who needed to disappear from men for a night or a week. A widow, she’d said. Above a cooper’s yard. The widow took no money, only asked you work for your keep. Mending nets. Scrubbing floors. A woman’s economy.

I tried to picture the chandler’s wife’s face, but all I could see was the fear in it, and the map she’d drawn in spilled beer. Two bridges down. A yard with a blue door. A green-shuttered window on the top floor.

It was a thread. The only one I had.

I moved, keeping to the shadows beneath the galleries. The sound of the boots was closer now, a coordinated sweep. They’d be checking doorways, questioning the early risers. A man stepping out to smoke would be shown a badge, leaned on. *A woman. Have you seen her?* The description would be accurate. They’d have it from the man on the bridge.

I found the second bridge—a narrow, hump-backed stone affair. I didn’t cross it. I went under it, into the cold, dripping dark where the water lapped against slimy steps. On the other side, I climbed back up to street level. There. A narrow passage between two houses, leading to a courtyard. And a blue door, faded and peeling.

The cooper’s yard was silent, stacked with barrels and the sweet smell of fresh-cut wood. A light was on in a ground-floor workshop. I ignored it. My eyes went to the top floor of the house attached to the yard. A green shutter, closed.

No time for stealth. I went to the side door of the house, a servant’s entrance. I tried the handle. Locked. I knocked, three sharp raps. Nothing. I knocked again, harder.

A shadow passed across the crack of light under the door. It stopped. They were listening.

“Marta sent me,” I hissed, the name of the chandler’s wife feeling like a lie on my tongue. “The nets need mending.”

A long pause. Then the sound of a heavy bolt being drawn back. The door opened a hand’s width. An eye, pale and deeply lined, peered out. It took me in—the damp coat, the wild hair, the case, the fear that clung to me like a smell. The eye didn’t widen. It just assessed.

“Marta’s dead,” the woman said, her voice a dry rustle. “Five years now.”

My heart sank. The thread snapped.

“But the nets still need mending,” the woman said. She opened the door wider. She was small, bent, wrapped in a shawl that had once been black. Her face was a net of wrinkles, but her gaze was clear and hard as river stone. “Come in. Quickly.”

I slipped inside. She bolted the door behind me, then turned. She didn’t ask my name. She looked at my leg. “You’re bleeding through your trousers.”

“It’s old.”

“It’s fresh.” She pointed a knotted finger at the case. “That the trouble?”

“Yes.”

“Not money?”

“No.”

She nodded, as if this confirmed something. “Men chasing a woman for something that isn’t money are the worst kind. Come upstairs. Don’t drip on my floor.”

I followed her up a narrow, steep staircase that groaned with every step. The house was clean but poor, smelling of soap and boiled cabbage. The top floor was a single, low-ceilinged room under the eaves, sparsely furnished: a cot, a chair, a washstand, a small stove. The green shutter was on the far wall.

“You have until full light,” she said, standing in the doorway. “They’ll do a house-to-house then. I can’t stop them. I can say I’ve seen nothing. They might believe an old woman. They might not.”

“Thank you.”

“Don’t thank me. The floor needs scrubbing. The pots downstairs need scouring. You’ll earn the hour.” She turned to go, then paused. “There’s a loose board under the cot. If that thing needs to not be found for a minute. It’s not deep.”

Then she was gone, her footsteps a soft shuffle on the stairs.

I stood in the centre of the room, the adrenaline leaching away, leaving me hollow and shaking. I listened. The yard outside was still quiet. But the city was waking up. Carts began to rumble on distant streets. A baby cried in a neighbouring house.

I looked at the case. I set it on the cot and opened the clasps. The metal was cold. Inside, nestled in grey felt, lay the device. It was all clean lines and polished brass, a series of interlocking cylinders and delicate gears. It looked like a scientific instrument, something for measuring stars or pressure. It looked innocent. It was not.

I had stolen it from a man who thought it was a key to fortune. He was wrong. It was a key to a different kind of lock. A theoretical one. A man at the university, a man with soft hands and a mind like a razor, had explained it to me in a room that smelled of dust and desperation. He called it a predictive regulator. Feed it data—tides, cargo manifests, telegraph traffic—and its gears would turn, its needles would quiver, and it would spit out a probability. A ship leaving on a certain day would meet bad weather. A certain stock would fall. A certain official would be vulnerable to blackmail on a certain date. It was a machine for seeing the weak points in the world’s weave.

The man with soft hands had wanted it destroyed. The man I stole it from wanted to sell it to the highest bidder. I had taken it for the money, and because the soft-handed man had looked at me not with lust or contempt, but with a kind of shared, grim understanding. *This should not exist,* he’d said. *Some threads are not meant to be pulled.*

Now the highest bidders were at the door. And they weren’t commercial interests. The precision of the net, the patience of it, the way they had taken De Visser without a sound—this was state work. The city’s own shadows had come to life.

I needed a new plan. I had an hour.

I lifted the loose board under the cot. A shallow space, just as she’d said, smelling of dust and old wood. I placed the case inside, closed the board, and dragged the cot back over it. It wouldn’t fool a proper search, but it would buy a moment of confusion.

Then I went downstairs. The old woman—she never gave me her name—was in the small, dark kitchen, a pile of blackened pots at her feet. She handed me a brush and a bucket of sand and lye. “Scour.”

I got on my knees. The work was mindless, brutal. The sand scraped my knuckles raw. The chemical smell bit my nostrils. But it was real. It grounded me. The old woman sat in a chair by the cold hearth, knitting something grey and endless, her needles clicking a steady, metronomic rhythm. She didn’t watch me work. She just let me exist in her space, a temporary problem to be managed.

“They’ll offer money,” she said, after a long silence broken only by the scrape of sand on iron. “For information. They’ll lean on the weak ones. The drunks. The debtors. The ones with secrets.”

“I know.”

“You have people? Anyone they can lean on?”

I thought of Jan. His face, impassive behind the bar. A prisoner or a participant. Either way, he was a pressure point. I thought of the few others who knew my face, my trade. Ghosts, all of them. But ghosts could be summoned, given form by the right threats.

“No,” I said. But it was a lie. There was always someone.

“Good,” she said, though I knew she didn’t believe me. “A woman alone is harder to crack. They have to find you first.”

I finished the last pot, my hands red and stinging. The light at the small window was stronger now, a flat, grey daylight. The hour was up.

As if on cue, a firm knock sounded at the front door. Not the side door. The official entrance.

The clicking of the knitting needles stopped. The old woman looked at me. “Attic. Now. Don’t make a sound.”

I moved, silent and fast, back up the groaning stairs. I didn’t go into the attic room. I stood on the small landing, pressed against the wall, listening.

I heard her shuffle to the door. Heard the bolt slide. Heard a man’s voice, polite, firm. City accent, but educated. Not a street-thug’s growl.

“Good morning, madam. Apologies for the early hour. City security. We’re inquiring after a person of interest. May we come in?”

“We?”

“Myself and my colleague.”

A pause. I imagined her blocking the doorway with her small, bent frame. “What person?”

“A woman. Late twenties. Dark hair. Possibly injured. She may be carrying a case.”

“I’ve seen no one. I’m an old woman. I sleep poorly, but I don’t wander.”

“Of course. But we must check, for your safety as well. She is considered dangerous.”

A soft, dry laugh. “More dangerous than two large men in my hallway? I doubt it. But check. Be quick. I have bread in the oven.”

Boots on the floorboards. Two pairs. They moved through the ground floor, opening doors. The kitchen. The workshop. Their steps were methodical, unhurried. They knew their business.

Then the stairs. They creaked under their weight. I shrank back, my hand going to the knife at my belt. It was a pathetic gesture. If they came up here, it was over.

They reached the first-floor landing. I heard a door open. A bedroom. Then another.

“What’s up here?” the polite voice asked.

“The attic. Storage. Leaks when it rains. Mind the third step, it’s loose.”

The third step groaned, loud and plaintive. One of them swore softly.

They were on the small landing. I was around the corner, in the dark of the attic room doorway. I held my breath.

The door to the attic room opened. I could see the slice of light from the window fall into the hall. I could hear them moving inside, a floorboard groaning.

“Empty,” a second voice said, younger, terser.

“Check the space.”

A moment of silence. Then the sound of the cot being dragged. My muscles coiled. They’d found it.

But the younger voice just said, “Nothing. Dust and old linen.”

They hadn’t lifted the board. They’d looked under the cot, seen nothing, and moved on. The old woman’s trick had worked. For now.

“Thank you for your cooperation, madam,” the polite voice said from downstairs. They were leaving. “If you see anything, you’ll contact the watch house on Koningstraat.”

The door closed. The bolt slid home.

I didn’t move. I waited, counting my heartbeats. After a full minute, I heard the old woman’s steps on the stairs again. She appeared on the landing, her face expressionless.

“They’re gone. For now. They’ll watch the streets. They’ll have someone on the bridges.”

“I need to get to the river,” I said. The words were out before I’d fully thought them. The river was chaos. Barges, tugs, fishermen, smugglers. It was a different city, with its own rules. It was the only place wide enough to swallow me.

“The river is two kilometres away,” she said. “Through their net.”

“I can’t stay here.”

“No.” She looked at my clothes. “You need to look like you belong. You need a reason to be moving at this hour.”

She went back downstairs. I followed. She went to a chest in the corner of the kitchen and pulled out a bundle of rough, grey cloth. She tossed it to me. It was a dress, plain and shapeless, and a stained apron. “Fish-gutter’s shift. Put it on. There’s a basket by the door. Take it. Go to the market at Sint Jansplein. It’s in the opposite direction of the river. Walk with purpose. Head down. If they stop you, you’re Griet, fetching her mistress’s order from the fishmonger. The mistress is Frau Vanderzee, three houses down. She’s deaf and mean. They’ll get nothing from her.”

I changed in the kitchen, turning my back to her. My own clothes, still damp, went into the basket under a scrap of cloth. The dress smelled of salt and blood. It was coarse against my skin. I tied the apron, tucking my knife into the waistband. I looked at myself in the dark glass of the window. A working woman. Invisible.

“The case,” I said.

“Leave it. You can’t carry it. It’s what they want. It’s what they’ll see.”

“I have to take it.”

Her old eyes hardened. “Then you’re a fool. And you’ll be caught by noon. That thing is a man’s trouble. Let it go.”

She was right. It was the logical move. Shed the weight, become a ghost. But the case was the only leverage I had left. It was the only thing between me and total helplessness. Without it, I was just a woman they wanted to silence. With it, I was a problem they had to solve.

“I’ll come back for it,” I said.

She didn’t answer. She just shook her head, a small, final motion. She knew I wouldn’t.

I took the basket and went to the side door. She unbolted it.

“The river,” she said. “You won’t get there by running. You get there by being someone else. Remember that.”

I stepped out into the courtyard. The light was full now, a damp, grey morning. I could hear the city properly awake. I adjusted the basket on my arm, felt the weight of my clothes hidden within it, the heavier weight of the choice I’d made. I lowered my head, slumped my shoulders into the weary slope of a domestic, and walked out into the street.

I turned towards Sint Jansplein, away from the water. I walked at the pace of drudgery, not flight. A cart rumbled past. A shopkeeper was taking down his shutters. I saw two men in long coats standing at the corner where my alley met the wider street. They were scanning faces. One of them glanced at me. His eyes passed over the dress, the apron, the basket, the downturned face. They moved on, looking for a limping woman in a wet coat, clutching a case.

I passed within three metres of them. The smell of their cheap tobacco cut through the morning air. I kept walking, my heart a hammer against my ribs. I didn’t look up. I was Griet. I had pots to scour and fish to fetch.

I turned the corner, putting them behind me. The market square opened up ahead, a cacophony of shouts and bartering, a crush of bodies. Safety, of a kind. I melted into the crowd, becoming one more grey shape in the morning throng.

But as I stood at a stall, pretending to examine a mackerel, I looked back the way I had come. The two men were still at the corner. They weren’t leaving. They were setting up a watch. They knew I was in the area. They were patient. They would wait, and watch, and question every woman of my general build who passed through their filter.

The net hadn’t been broken. It had just been refined. They were no longer chasing. They were sieving.

And I was in the sieve, dressed as a piece of grit, with the river shining like a mirage two kilometres to the west. I had traded a sprint for a slow, perilous filtration. I had the disguise. I had the direction.

But I had left the key to my freedom under a loose board in an old woman’s attic. And I knew, with a cold certainty that settled in my bones, that I would have to go back for it. The machine was my only coin in a world that traded only in power. Without it, I was just another woman trying to escape the grip of men who had decided she was in the way.

The hunt was no longer a chase. It was a waiting game. And I had just walked onto their board.

# Chapter 18

## **Chapter 18**

The market’s noise was a wool blanket, thick and smothering. It pressed against my ears, a wall of shouted prices and complaints and the wet slap of fish on marble slabs. I stood at the stall, the mackerel’s dead eye staring up at me, its scales dull in the grey light. My own reflection wavered in the film of its pupil: a pinched face under a linen cap, a stranger’s fear. Griet’s fear. I let my fingers, red and chapped from the canal water, brush the fish’s cold flank. A performance of consideration. A housewife’s deliberation.

All the while, my blood sang a single, shrill note: *they are still there*.

I had outrun the dogs, but the hunters had simply closed the gate. They were leaning against the brickwork of the bakery now, the two long coats. They had lit fresh cigarettes, the smoke a pale grey signal against the damp air. They were settled. This was no longer pursuit; it was a shift. One watched the mouth of my alley. The other let his gaze drift over the crowd, a slow, mechanical sweep. They had all day. They had the authority to stop any woman who fit the silhouette of their suspicion. My disguise was my cage. To run now would be to paint a target on my back. To stay was to let the sieve shake me slowly, inevitably, into their hands.

The fishmonger, a woman with forearms like dock ropes and a face carved from salt, narrowed her eyes at me. “You going to buy that or pray over it?”

I flinched, the Griet in me rising to the surface with a practised cower. “Sorry. It’s… the price.”

She snorted, turning to shout at a boy lugging a crate of mussels. The moment broke. I stepped back, melting into the eddy of bodies. The basket on my arm was an anchor, pulling me down into the role. I moved with the current of the crowd, letting it carry me deeper into the square, away from the western edge where the river lay, away from the men. Every step was a betrayal of my need. The machine called from its hiding place like a second heartbeat, a dull, insistent throb of loss beneath my ribs.

I needed a different kind of currency. The kind Jan traded in at *De Visser*: information, favour, the subtle leverage of a debt. But Jan was across the city, and the only capital I had here was the fiction of Griet, and the few coins in the pocket of this dead woman’s dress.

I bought a loaf of black bread. I bought two withered turnips. Each transaction was a stitch in the tapestry of my cover. I spoke in the flat, clipped tones of the district, my head bowed. I became a moving part of the market’s machinery, a cog greased with mundane worry. I saw other women like me—or like Griet—their faces closed as shutters, their movements economical. They navigated the press of bodies with a weary expertise, a silent sisterhood of labour. We were ghosts in plain sight, seen only for our function: to buy, to cook, to clean, to birth. To be sieved from the world of consequence.

A hand closed around my upper arm.

It was not a rough grip, but it was absolute. The fingers, thick and strong, pressed through the wool of my sleeve. My heart stopped, then slammed against my breastbone like a bird in a chimney. I did not look up. I became a stone. A piece of grit.

“You. Girl.”

The voice was a man’s, bored, official. It came from above and to my left. I made my eyes wide and blank, turning my head just enough. It was one of the long coats. His partner was still at the corner, a sentry against the brick. This one had waded into the stream to pluck out a likely piece of flotsam. Me.

“Meneer?” I let my voice go thin, reedy.

His face was long, sallow. He had the eyes of a clerk, not a thug; this was worse. This was procedure. “Where do you live?”

“Kuipersteeg, meneer. Number five.” The lie was ready, a flat on the other side of the square, not near my alley.

“What’s in the basket?”

I showed him. Bread. Turnips. The mackerel I had not bought. He poked at them with a gloved finger.

“You’re out early.”

“The master likes his breakfast by seven, meneer.” I kept my gaze on the second button of his coat. Subservient. Uninteresting.

“See a woman running this way? Earlier. Limping. Looked… out of place.”

I allowed a flicker of confusion to cross my face. A servant’s comprehension was slow, carefully doled out. “Running, meneer? No. Only the fish carts. And the boys.” I risked a glance up, then quickly down. “Is there trouble?”

He studied me. His look was not of suspicion, but of assessment. Was I worth more questions? Was my face the one on the leaflet in his pocket? I felt the weight of the disguise like a suit of lead. He was not seeing *me*. He was seeing class, gender, utility. He was deciding if this particular tool was the one he needed.

A shout went up from a cheese stall—an argument over weight. The market’s noise, which had dampened around us, surged back. His partner at the corner gestured impatiently. Their net was wide; I was one small fish. The calculus of his boredom tipped.

He released my arm. “Move along. Don’t dawdle.”

“Yes, meneer.” I bobbed my head, a shallow, instinctive dip, and scurried into the thicker crowd, my basket clutched tight. The heat of shame that flooded me was not Griet’s. It was mine. The performance had been perfect because it was not a performance at all. It was a language he expected me to speak, and I had spoken it fluently. I had traded on my own invisibility. It had saved my skin and hollowed out my chest.

I did not stop shaking until I was three streets over, in the lee of a chandlery, the smell of tar and rope a solid thing in the air. I leaned against the wet brick, breathing hard. The false victory of my escape curdled in my gut. I had not outsmarted them. I had merely conformed, perfectly, to the narrow channel they allowed for women like me. The disguise worked because it was a prison they recognised.

The machine. It was the only thing that ever made a space for me that was my own. A space of gears and pressure, of cause and effect I controlled. It was a man’s world, that world of mechanics, but within the cradle of its logic, my hands were the only ones that mattered. Without it, I was back in the sieve. Griet. Els. Names for the same commodity.

I had to go back.

The logic was as cold and clean as a steel bearing. The attic room was in the heart of the area they were watching. They would be looking for someone fleeing, not returning. They would be looking for a limping woman in a coat, not a maid with a basket, finishing her marketing. The old woman, Mrs. de Wit—she was a variable. Had they questioned her? Would she give me up for a guilder? Or was her solitude its own kind of fortress?

I had no other move. The river was a taunt. Freedom was a locked door, and the key was under a warped floorboard in a room that smelled of dust and mothballs.

I spent the day in a purgatory of slow movement. I walked the perimeter of their net, a rat learning the dimensions of its trap. I saw them stop two other women. One, older, they let go quickly. The second, younger, closer to my build, they questioned at length. I watched from the doorway of a haberdashery, my face half-hidden by a row of hanging aprons. I saw the woman’s shoulders hunch, her hands twist. She had nothing to tell them. Her fear was answer enough. They let her go, but the message was etched in the air: *we can do this. All day. To any of you.*

The afternoon bled into a damp, early twilight. The market packed away. The shopkeepers pulled their shutters closed. The long coats were replaced by two others, a changing of the guard. The sieve remained.

This was my window. The dogged patience of the day shift would be at its lowest ebb. The night shift would be fresh, their eyes sharper for movement in the growing dark. But the transition itself was a moment of blurred responsibility.

I emptied my basket of its pathetic provisions behind a rain barrel. The bread, the turnips. I kept the shawl. My heart was a cold, hard knot. I was not returning to hide. I was returning to steal back a piece of myself.

The alley, when I turned into it, was a canyon of shadows. The few windows were already glowing yellow, curtains drawn. I walked with Griet’s tired trudge, head down, a servant returning from an errand. The sound of my own footsteps was too loud. I passed the doorway where I’d slept. I passed the pump. The silence was a held breath.

The door to Mrs. de Wit’s building was unlocked. The stairwell was dark, smelling of cabbage and mildew. I climbed, each creak of the wood a thunderclap in the hush. On her landing, I paused. No light showed under her door. No sound came from within.

My attic door was as I’d left it. I slipped inside, into the absolute black. I stood for a full minute, listening to the blood roar in my ears, waiting for a footstep on the stair, for the old woman’s cough. Nothing.

I crossed to the far wall on my knees, my hands sweeping the rough planks. My fingers found the familiar warp, the nail head. I pried it up.

The emptiness beneath was a physical shock.

I plunged my hand into the space, sweeping it left, right. Dust. Splinters. Nothing. My breath hitched. I felt along the adjacent board, pried it up too. More nothing.

A cold deeper than the canal water seeped into my bones. She had found it. Mrs. de Wit. While I was playing Griet in the market, she had been up here, prying up my floorboards.

The loss was so total it felt like a vacuum. I knelt in the dark, my hands flat on the empty hole. The machine. My designs. The only proof that I was more than the world’s grit. Gone.

A floorboard creaked behind me.

I froze. The door was still closed. The sound had come from within the room.

“I wondered when you’d come back.” The voice was Mrs. de Wit’s, but stripped of its quaver. It was dry, precise. A click, and the warm glow of an oil lamp flooded the attic. She stood by the dormer window, a shape in a dark dress, the lamp in her hand. Her eyes were not the milky, vague things I remembered. They were sharp, and they held me pinned.

“You took it,” I said. My voice was flat. Dead.

“It’s safe,” she said. She didn’t move. “A remarkable piece of work. The tolerances. The spring mechanism. It’s not a locksmith’s tool. It’s a musician’s instrument.”

She understood it. The realisation was a second blow.

“What do you want?” I asked, still on my knees. The power balance had not just shifted; it had inverted. She was the holder of my soul. I was the supplicant.

“I want to know who you are,” she said. “The men at the corner are city watch, but the questions they’re asking… they’re not for a petty thief. They’re for someone who has offended a powerful man. The machine offends in a particular way. It is a key to places you are not meant to go.”

I said nothing. The silence stretched. She took a step forward, the lamplight carving deep gullies in her ancient face.

“My husband was a clockmaker,” she said, her gaze drifting to the window, to the darkening sky. “A genius with tiny things. He made a singing bird for the daughter of a burgomaster. A masterpiece. They paid him in praise and a pittance. When he asked for what it was worth, they laughed. They broke his hands with a hammer so he could not make another for their rivals. He spent the last twenty years of his life watching his own genius leak away into pain and regret.” Her eyes snapped back to mine. “I know the smell of a man who fears a clever thing in the wrong hands. Who is he?”

“Visser,” I whispered. The name was ash in my mouth. “Hendrik Visser.”

A slow nod. “The shipping magnate. A man who owns doors, and the right to open them.” She placed the lamp on the floor between us. “So. You are a woman with a machine that opens doors, and Hendrik Visser wants you stopped. That makes you either the greatest fool in the city, or the only interesting person to have darkened my doorstep in a decade.”

“I need it back,” I said, the plea naked in my voice.

“Why? To run? They will catch you. A woman alone, with a singular tool… you are a beacon. You have already learned you cannot run as a woman. You can only… dissipate.” She gestured to my Griet clothes. “That is a slow death.”

“What choice do I have?”

She smiled then, a thin, papery thing. “You stop being the grit in the sieve. You become the hand that shakes it.” She bent, with a stiffness that was not feigned, and from the shadows by her feet, she lifted the leather case. My case. She held it out. “Take it.”

I stared, unmoving. It was a trick. It had to be.

“Your design has a flaw,” she said, her voice clinical now. “The third actuator spring. It’s under too much tension. It will fatigue, then snap, at the worst possible moment. My husband’s notes are in the case. A modification. It will hold.”

I rose, my legs numb. I took the case. The familiar weight was a shock of warmth. “Why?”

“Because Visser broke my husband’s hands,” she said, her voice like iron filings. “And I am too old to break his neck. But you… you have the key to his doors. And I have just given you the means to turn it in the lock without it breaking in your hand.” She stepped closer, her sharp eyes boring into mine. “Running is what they expect. It is the woman’s option. Hiding is what they expect. What they do not expect is for the mouse to turn and gnaw through the ropes of the winch. To collapse the trap on the trapper.”

The idea was so vast, so terrifying, it left no room for breath. Not escape. Not hiding. *Attack.*

“I am one woman,” I breathed.

“You are a woman with a machine that opens anything,” she corrected. “Visser’s power is built on locks. On vaults. On private rooms and secured ledgers. On the assumption that what is his stays his. You are a solvent to that assumption.” She turned back to the window. “The men outside are looking for a fugitive. Be something else. Be a ghost in his machine. Be a rumour in his walls. Make him afraid of his own locks.”

She was handing me not just my tool, but a new direction. A war, not a flight. The false victory of my escape was truly shattered now, blown apart not by capture, but by this offer of a different, more terrible path. The gender dynamics I had used as a shield were now a weapon she was placing in my hands. They would not look for a saboteur in a maid’s dress. They would not suspect the quiet, fearful gender of audacity.

“They will hurt you,” I said. “When they find you helped me.”

She did not look back. “Let them try. I have been waiting twenty years for a reason to make a noise.”

I looked down at the case. It was no longer just my freedom. It was a weapon. A declaration. I had walked onto their board as a piece to be captured. Mrs. de Wit was telling me to flip the board and set it on fire.

“Thank you,” I said, the words utterly inadequate.

“Go out the back,” she said, pointing to a small, hinged panel in the wall I had never noticed—a servant’s pass-through from a time when the attic housed live-in help. “It leads to the roof of the washhouse, then down to the next street. Avoid the sieve.”

I moved to the panel, my mind churning with the seismic shift of it all. As I pushed it open, letting in a gust of damp, free air, she spoke once more.

“Els.”

I turned. She had never asked my name.

“Make it sing,” she said.

Then she blew out the lamp, plunging herself, and the attic, and the ghost of her husband, back into the dark.

I slipped through the opening, onto the steep, wet tiles. The case was solid in my grip. Below, in the street, I could see the glow of a watchman’s lantern, a tiny star in the gloom. They were still sieving. Still waiting for the woman who ran.

I turned my face away from the river, away from the west. I looked east, towards the old city, where the gabled houses of the wealthy crowded together, where Hendrik Visser’s offices overlooked his docks.

The hunt was no longer a waiting game. It was a different game entirely. And I had just been given the only piece that mattered.

I began to climb down, away from the light, into a different kind of dark.

# Chapter 19

## **Chapter 19**

The dark between the gables was a different substance than the dark of the attic. It was cold and wet and alive with the drip of condensation from rusted gutters, the scuttle of rats in the valleys of the tiles. I moved across the roof of the washhouse, the leather case a hard, accusing weight against my ribs. The tiles were slick with a film of city grime, each step a negotiation with gravity. Below, the watchman’s lantern bobbed, a patient, predatory glow. They were sieving the streets, but the rooftops of this district were a forgotten lattice, a world for cats and chimney sweeps and now, for me.

I dropped from the washhouse eaves into a narrow alley that smelled of wet stone and cat piss. The case thumped against my side. I paused, listening. The murmur of the search was a street over, the calls of the watchmen muffled by brick. They were looking for a fugitive, a desperate creature fleeing west towards the river and the promise of a boat. They were not looking for a woman walking with purpose east, into the heart of the merchant belt, carrying a gentleman’s valise.

That was the first lie. The dress was the second.

I found a recessed doorway, deep enough to swallow the light from the distant streetlamp. My fingers, numb with cold and the aftermath of the attic’s revelation, worked at the clasps of the case. They opened with a soft, oiled click. Inside, nestled in fitted velvet, was not a spy’s kit of lockpicks and poisons, but a uniform. A maid’s uniform, severe and grey, with a white apron folded crisp as a legal document. Beneath it, a pair of sensible, low-heeled shoes. At the very bottom, wrapped in a scrap of silk, was a bone-handled paring knife, its edge honed to a wicked gleam. A tool, not a weapon. A woman’s instrument.

I shed my own coat, the damp wool reeking of the river and fear. The cold bit through my blouse. The maid’s dress was coarse, a rough-spun wool that scratched at my neck and wrists. It was several sizes too large, meant for a broader, stouter frame. Mrs. de Wit’s frame, twenty years ago. I used the belt to gather the excess fabric, pulling it tight until it was merely shapeless, not engulfing. The apron strings I tied in a precise, efficient bow at the small of my back. The shoes were a close enough fit. I bundled my own clothes into the case, tucked the knife into the deep pocket of the apron, and left the case in the shadowed corner of the doorway. An offering to the alley. A discarded piece of a previous game.

I stepped out of the alcove.

The transformation was not in the mirror, for there was none. It was in the space I now occupied in the world. My shoulders, which had been set in a defensive hunch, now rounded forward naturally, my chin dipping towards my chest. My stride, which I forced into a long, ground-eating pace, shortened to quick, efficient steps. The change was not posture alone. It was a yielding, a making of oneself small within the available space. I had observed it a thousand times in the women who served at *De Visser*, in the scullery maids who darted through the grand houses like mice. It was an art of invisibility through expectedness.

I turned onto the broader street. A pair of watchmen, their greatcoats dark with rain, stood under the eaves of a chandler’s shop. One held a lantern aloft, its light carving hollows in their faces. I did not avoid them. I did not meet their eyes. I kept my gaze lowered to the cobbles three paces ahead, my hands clasped loosely in front of me, the very picture of a servant on an errand, hurrying home before the curfew bell. The light washed over me. I felt it like a physical touch.

“You there,” one called, his voice bored.

I stopped, my body tensing not into flight, but into a respectful, fearful stillness. I turned my head just enough, keeping my eyes downcast. “Meneer?”

“Out late. Whose house?”

“Mevrouw van der Linde, meneer. On the Keizersgracht. Sent for more candles.” My voice was higher, softer, stripped of the gravel I cultivated at the bar. It was the voice of a girl who expected to be chastised.

He grunted. “Van der Linde’s lot are always burning midnight oil. Counting their guilders, I’d wager. Get on with you. Straight home, mind.”

“Yes, meneer. Thank you, meneer.”

I scurried past, the subservience a sour taste in my mouth. Their attention, that searching, suspicious beam, had slid right off the grey wool and the white apron. I was furniture. I was part of the city’s background noise. The power of it was dizzying, and utterly repellent. This was the shield. This meekness, this expected fear, was the cloak that rendered me unseen. Mrs. de Wit had not given me a disguise. She had given me a social blind spot.

The rain had settled into a persistent drizzle. The grand houses of the eastern canals were monuments of shadow and gilded light, their windows glowing behind thick curtains. I knew Hendrik Visser’s house. Everyone did. It was not the oldest, but it was the most aggressively maintained, a statement in red brick and white trim that glared across the water at its rivals. His offices, however, were separate. A merchant prince did not soil his home with ledgers and the smell of anxious clerks. His domain was a narrow, four-story building wedged between a sugar refinery and a shipping insurer’s, overlooking his own docks. It was a fortress of commerce, and it was where he would be, even at this hour, on the eve of a major shipment. He would be counting, like van der Linde, but his count would be of crates and timetables, of profit and risk.

I approached from the rear, through a service lane choked with delivery carts and empty barrels. The back of the building was a plain façade of soot-stained brick, punctuated by a heavy oak door and a line of high, grimy windows. The ground-floor window was lit. The kitchen, or a clerk’s late-night pantry. A single window on the third floor also showed a faint, steady glow. An office. His office.

The lock on the service door was a heavy, iron thing, but it was oiled for daily use. The paring knife was too light, too short. I needed a different key. I retreated into the deeper shadows, my mind working. A maid did not pick locks. A maid had legitimate reasons to be near doors.

I waited. The drizzle seeped through the coarse wool, finding my skin. Time stretched, measured in the distant bells of the Westerkerk, each chime a hammer fall on the city’s quiet. Then, the service door opened. A young kitchen boy, yawning, shuffled out with a bucket of slops. He trudged towards a midden heap at the end of the lane, his shoulders slumped with tiredness.

The door swung shut behind him, but not fully. It caught, perhaps on a warped floorboard inside, leaving a gap of two inches.

I moved as he emptied his bucket, the sound masking my steps. As he turned back, rubbing his eyes, I was already at the door, my body angled as if I had just emerged. I held it open for him, a small, silent courtesy.

He blinked, surprised to see another servant in the gloom. “Oh. Thanks.”

I offered a tight, tired smile, the universal language of the overworked. “Long night.”

“Aren’t they all,” he muttered, and slipped past me inside.

I followed him in, pulling the door quietly closed. The expectedness. He did not question my presence because my presence was expected. The kitchen was a cavern of shadows, lit by the dying embers in a vast hearth. The air was thick with the smells of old grease, boiled cabbage, and yeast. A scullery maid dozed on a stool by the sink. The boy disappeared through another door.

I did not hesitate. A maid in a house had purpose, direction. I walked through the kitchen, past the sleeping girl, and into a stone-flagged passageway. A set of narrow, twisting stairs led upwards, the wood worn smooth in the centers by generations of servants’ feet. I took them, my soft shoes making no sound. The building had a different breath at night, a hollow, creaking stillness. From behind a door on the second floor, I heard the scratch of a pen and the soft sigh of a man. A clerk, working late.

The third-floor landing was darker, carpeted in a worn runner that swallowed my steps. The light seeped from under a single door, a bar of yellow against the gloom. I pressed my ear to the wood. Silence. Then, the crisp, definitive sound of a ledger being closed. A chair scraped.

I retreated to a shallow alcove where a broom and dustpan were kept. I took the broom, leaning it against the wall as if I’d just been interrupted. The performance was everything. The door opened.

Hendrik Visser filled the doorway, not with bulk, but with presence. He was a tall man, lean as a whip, his hair steel-grey and swept back from a high forehead. He wore a dark blue house coat over his shirt and trousers. In one hand he held a ledger, in the other, a glass of what looked like port. His face was all angles and calculation, the eyes pale and distant, as if permanently fixed on a horizon line of profit and loss. He did not see me, tucked in my alcove. He looked down the hall towards the stairs, his mind clearly on other things.

He turned back into his office, leaving the door ajar. I heard the clink of decanter on glass, the rustle of papers.

This was the moment. The knife in my apron pocket was a cold comfort. This was not a task for a blade. It was a task for a ghost, for the unremarked gender that cleaned up after the decisions of men. I left the broom. I stepped to the door and pushed it open just enough to slide through.

The office was a testament to controlled power. It was not large, but every object in it was of the finest quality and utterly functional. A vast oak desk, clear but for a brass lamp, an inkstand, and the ledger. Shelves of identical ledgers lined one wall. A large window, now black with night, would by day command a view of the Visser docks. A fire guttered low in the grate. He stood with his back to me, staring into the embers, the glass of port held loosely in his fingers.

He spoke without turning. “I said the figures could wait until morning, Pieter.”

His voice was dry, precise. It was the voice of a man accustomed to being obeyed, to the world arranging itself according to his ledgers.

I did not answer. I let the silence stretch, a different quality of silence than the obedient silence of a clerk.

He turned. His eyes found me, and for a fraction of a second, there was no recognition, only a flicker of irritation at the interruption. Then the irritation cooled into something harder, more analytical. He looked at the grey dress, the apron, the downcast eyes I no longer bothered to fully maintain.

“You are not from this house,” he stated. It was not a question.

“No, meneer.”

“How did you get in?”

“The kitchen door was open, meneer.”

He took a slow sip of his port, his gaze never leaving me. He was assessing me as he would a piece of dubious cargo. “You are the one they are sieving for. The woman from the river.”

I said nothing. The admission was in my presence, in the quiet defiance of my posture.

A faint, cold smile touched his lips. “And you come to me. In a maid’s dress. That is either remarkably stupid or remarkably bold. Which is it?”

“I came to ask a question, meneer.”

He raised an eyebrow, amused. “A question. You disrupt my night, invade my premises, and you wish to conduct an interview? You have the advantage of me. You know my name. I do not know yours.”

“Els.”

“Els.” He rolled the name on his tongue, finding no flavor there. “And your question, Els?”

I met his pale eyes fully then, dropping the pretense of the maid. “The *Zuiderkroon* sails on the morning tide. Its manifest is sealed by your office. What is in hold seven?”

All amusement vanished from his face. It became a mask of polished stone. He set his glass down on the desk with a soft, definitive click. “You are not a customs inspector. You are not a rival merchant. You are a barmaid with a talent for trouble. Why would you care about a ship’s hold?”

“Because people who ask about it end up in the river.”

“An occupational hazard of curiosity in this city.” He walked around his desk, not approaching me, but moving to stand behind it, placing its solid bulk between us. A tactical repositioning. “Hold seven contains machine parts. Lathes. For the Swedish ironworks. The paperwork is in order.”

“Machine parts do not require a man like Maarten to guard them. Or a man like De Wilde to kill for them.”

The name De Wilde did what I hoped it would. A tiny fissure appeared in the stone. A minute tightening around his eyes. He knew the name. He knew the kind of work it implied.

“You are speaking of things beyond your understanding,” he said, his voice lower. “You have stumbled into a game where the pieces are not yours to move.”

“Mrs. de Wit gave me the piece,” I said.

Now the stone cracked. His hand, resting on the ledger, went very still. The name of his former master’s widow, spoken in this context, was a key turning in a lock he thought sealed. He looked at me anew, not as a nuisance, but as a genuine anomaly. A variable his ledger had not accounted for.

“Agatha,” he breathed, the word a mix of disbelief and dawning fury. “She sent you here. In this… costume.”

“She told me to make it sing.”

He was silent for a long moment, his gaze turning inward, computing. I could see the connections being made behind his eyes: the sieving, the missing woman, the valise from his old master’s house, the question about the hold. He arrived at the conclusion with the speed of a master accountant.

“You have the case,” he said.

“I had it.”

“And you think coming here, asking me this, will achieve what? My confession? A change of heart?” A bitter laugh escaped him. “You are a message from a ghost, nothing more. Agatha seeks to haunt me from her attic. It is a pathetic gesture.”

“What is in the hold, Visser?”

He leaned forward, his palms flat on the desk. “Power, you foolish woman. Pure, condensed power. Not guilders, not influence. The kind of power that rewrites maps and topples councils. The kind of power your mind cannot even encompass. It is a transaction. A delivery. The culmination of twenty years of patience and planning. And it is none of your concern.”

“It became my concern when your men tried to put me in the water.”

“A regrettable overzealousness. You were seen with the wrong person. You became a loose thread. Loose threads are clipped.” He straightened. “But you are not a thread. You are a splinter. And you have walked into the heart of the wood. Pieter!”

His call was sharp, clear. From down the hall, I heard the clerk’s door open, footsteps.

The performance was over. The shield of the dress was paper against the direct gaze of its master. I did not run for the door. He would expect that. I moved towards the window.

“There is no exit there,” Visser said, a note of contempt returning. “It is three floors to the cobbles.”

The footsteps were in the hallway now. Not just Pieter’s. Heavier, quicker. More than one.

I reached the window, fumbling with the latch. It was stiff, painted shut. I yanked at it, the cheap fabric of the dress straining at my shoulders.

The office door opened. Pieter, a thin man with ink-stained fingers, stood there, blinking. Behind him were two others—not clerks. They had the broad shoulders and empty eyes of warehouse enforcers, men who handled crates and problems with equal brute force.

“Take her,” Visser said, his voice returning to its dry, managerial calm. “Quietly. The same as the others.”

The two men stepped forward. I stopped fighting the latch. My hand dipped into my apron pocket and closed around the bone handle of the paring knife. I did not draw it. I turned to face Visser, my back to the dark window.

“Machine parts,” I said, my voice flat. “For the Swedish ironworks.”

He nodded, a dismissive gesture. “Precisely.”

The enforcers were three paces away. Pieter hovered in the doorway, a spectator.

“Then you won’t mind,” I said, “if I check the paperwork.”

With my free hand, I swept the brass desk lamp off the desk. It was heavy, full of oil. It struck the floor with a crash of glass and metal, and the oil, fed by the wick, erupted in a *whoosh* of hungry flame across the dry wood and the scattered papers.

Visser’s composure shattered. “You mad bitch!”

The enforcers halted, startled by the sudden wall of heat and light that bloomed between us. The fire, fed by ledger pages, leaped towards the shelves. Pieter cried out.

In the chaos, I turned back to the window. This time, I did not fumble. I drove the heel of the paring knife’s handle against the latch, once, twice. The old paint cracked. I wrenched it open.

Cold, wet night air rushed in, battling the heat of the fire. Below was a sheer drop to a brick-paved courtyard.

“Stop her!” Visser roared, beating at the flames on his desk with his house coat.

One of the enforcers lunged through the growing fire, his hand grabbing for my arm. I twisted, and the coarse sleeve of the maid’s dress tore in his grip. I brought the paring knife up, not to stab, but to slash—a sharp, shallow cut across the back of his grasping hand. He snarled, recoiling more in surprise than pain.

It was enough. I put a foot on the windowsill, the city’s breath cold on my face. I did not look down. I looked at Hendrik Visser, his face a mask of fury illuminated by his own burning ledgers.

“I’ll be checking the manifest,” I said.

Then I pushed myself out, not down, but across the narrow gap to the roof of the adjacent sugar refinery. It was a leap of faith and desperation, a span of five feet of black, rainy air. The apron billowed, the grey dress flapped. My feet hit the sloped, lead-clad roof, skidded on the wet metal, and I fell forward, my hands scrabbling for purchase. I slid, a cascade of noise, until my toes jammed against a runoff gutter.

I lay there, gasping, the smell of burning ledger and my own fear sharp in my nose. Shouts echoed from Visser’s window. They would not follow this way. They would take the stairs, flood into the lane. I had minutes.

I pushed myself up. The refinery roof was a complex terrain of vents and chimneys. I moved across it, away from the light and the noise, my body aching, the maid’s dress torn and smudged with soot. The shield was gone, burned away in that office. They knew my face now. They knew I had the knowledge, and the will to act on it.

But I knew something, too. His reaction was the confirmation. Hold seven of the *Zuiderkroon* did not contain lathes. It contained the reason for everything. The source of the power he coveted. And he was terrified I would reach it.

I dropped from the refinery roof into a different alley, my body a symphony of new pains. The curfew bell began to toll, a deep, sonorous knell that rolled over the city. The sieving would intensify. They would be looking for a maid, now. A specific maid, with a torn dress and a knife.

I had no weapon but the truth. No shield but the audacity he thought my gender incapable of. The board was on fire. And I was not a piece. I was the hand that held the match.

Somewhere to the west, in the vast, dark throat of the river, the *Zuiderkroon* waited for the tide. It was no longer just a ship. It was a vault. And I had just blown the lock off its secret.

I melted into the maze of the old city, a grey ghost against the older stones, the taste of smoke and port on the air behind me. The hunt was no longer me fleeing them. It was me hunting the truth, and they knew it. The game had changed again. And for the first time, I saw a flicker of fear in the eyes of the man who kept the ledgers.

# Chapter 20

## **Chapter 20**

The rain had gentled to a persistent, probing mist that seeped through stone and spirit alike. It beaded on the wool of my stolen jacket—a man’s work coat, rough and smelling of fish-oil and sweat, taken from a line in a cramped courtyard. The grey dress was a sodden bundle weighted with a brick and dropped into a canal. I was a dockworker now, cap pulled low, shoulders hunched in a way that felt less like disguise and more like the natural curl of a creature expecting a blow.

The knowledge was a cold, hard stone in my gut. Hold seven. The source. It was no longer an abstract suspicion in a ledger; it was a physical place, a thing I could touch, if I could only reach it. De Vries’s fear had been a hotter, brighter thing than any anger. It had been the pure, incandescent terror of a man who sees the linchpin of his world wobble. That terror was my compass now.

But the city had tightened like a fist around a suspected infection. Patrols moved in pairs, their boots a synchronized threat on the wet cobbles. The usual nocturnal murmur of the docks—the furtive deals, the loading of contraband by lantern-light—was absent, smothered under the weight of official attention. The *Zuiderkroon* was a silhouette against the lesser dark of the river, a black cut-out studded with a few guarded pinpricks of light. A vault, indeed. And every eye on the waterfront was a lock.

I needed a key. Not a physical one. A distraction. A shift in the board that would pull their gaze away from the ship and the river.

Jan’s face surfaced in my mind, the way he’d pushed the *jenever* across the zinc. Payment expected later. Usually coin. But he dealt in other currencies: information, silence, the careful direction of a certain kind of clientele. He was a pivot. Men like De Vries saw the *De Visser* as a useful gutter, a place where the dregs of their schemes could be quietly disposed of. They never considered that the gutter had ears, and a memory, and its own slow, patient currents.

The tavern was quieter than I’d ever seen it. The usual crowd of off-shift refinery men and canal-boat pilots was thin, made up of the most desperate or the most connected. A tense silence hung in the air, thicker than the smoke. Conversations were whispers. The clink of a glass was a minor explosion.

Jan was polishing the same spot on the counter with a grim, methodical energy. He didn’t look up as I approached, my work-boots making soft, wet sounds on the floorboards. I didn’t take a stool. I stood at the end of the bar, where the light was poorest.

“They’re pulling men from the east-end refineries,” I said, my voice low, stripped of anything that could be called feminine. It was just a rasp of fatigue. “Double watches on the company warehouses. Not for theft. For containment.”

His polishing didn’t falter. “Bad weather makes for poor security.”

“This isn’t the weather. It’s a leak. A specific one. They think it’s headed for the river.”

Now he looked up. His eyes, small and dark in the forest of his beard, held no surprise. Only a weary calculation. He saw the man’s coat, the cap, the posture. But he looked past it, to the set of my jaw, the unblinking directness of my gaze. He saw *me*.
“The river is a big place. Easy to drown in.”

“Not if every skiff and lighter is being stopped and searched. Not if the Port Master’s men have orders to detain anything female and alone.” I let a hint of the old voice through, a sliver of steel. “They’ve painted a target. And they’re holding the brush.”

He sighed, a sound like gravel shifting. He poured two fingers of *jenever* into a tumbler and slid it toward me. “And you’re here to… what? Wait for the tide?”

“I’m here to change it.” I left the glass untouched. “The *Zuiderkroon* sails with the morning tide. Before then, they’ll move the cargo from hold seven. It’s too hot to stay. They’ll try to land it somewhere quiet, upriver or along the coast. They need a distraction. A bigger fire to fight.”

A flicker in his eyes. Not interest. Caution. “Starting fires is a young man’s game. It leaves ashes. And bodies.”

“This city runs on a slow fire, Jan. It’s just contained in furnaces and ledgers and the bellies of ships. All I’m suggesting is… redirecting the fuel. For an hour. Maybe two.” I leaned forward, my palms flat on the sticky wood. “The east-end refinery men. They’re restless. Pulled from their shifts, told it’s for security, but they see the company guards getting bonus pay. They smell the inequality. It’s a tinderbox.”

He laughed, a short, humorless bark. “And you want me to strike the match? I run a tavern, not a revolution.”

“You run a clearing house. For grievances, and for solutions. You know the foreman, Pieter. The one with the debt to the company store. The one whose brother vanished after asking about pension funds.” I’d heard the stories here, in this room, over months. The low, resentful murmurs I’d filed away as background noise. Now they were a ledger of a different kind. “He’s proud. And angry. If he thought the company was using him and his men as pawns, to cover something that would make the directors richer while his family starves… his pride wouldn’t let him stand for it.”

Jan studied me for a long moment. The guttural murmur of the tavern seemed to recede. Here was the calculation: my value against my danger. I was danger incarnate now. But I was also a vector. A way to direct the coming explosion away from his walls, and toward the interests of the men who looked down on this place and everyone in it.

“What do you offer?” he asked finally. Not in coin.

“The truth. The reason for the panic. Not rumors. Not ‘company business.’ The fact that De Vries is terrified of what’s in that hold. That he’d beggar every man in this room to protect it. Give Pieter that. Not as a plea. As a weapon. Let him decide what to do with it.”

He nodded, slowly. A decision made. “The *jenever* is on the house tonight. For certain customers. The talk will be… pointed.” He met my eyes. “But you won’t be here to see it. And if you are caught, you fell from a roof. You stole that coat. You have never spoken to me.”

“Understood.” I finally took the glass, tossed the liquor back. It was fire and caraway and the taste of a bargain with the devil you know. “One more thing. I need to get to the *Zuiderkroon*. Not at the docks. Out in the stream. After the distraction starts, but before they can move the cargo.”

He stared at me as if I’d asked him to fetch the moon. Then a slow, grudging respect dawned in his face. “Madness.”

“The only currency they don’t account for.”

He jerked his head toward the back. “There’s a boy. Klaas. He’s simple. He loves the river. He knows every current, every eddy, like a lover’s skin. He takes a skiff out at night sometimes, to be away from the noise. He moors it at the old, broken pier behind the tannery. No one bothers him.” Jan’s gaze was flint. “If you bother him, if you bring trouble to his boat, I will find you. And what I will do will make De Vries look like a gentleman.”

“Where will he be?”

“Where he always is. Looking at the water.”

***

The broken pier was a skeleton of blackened wood reaching a few futile feet into the dark water. The tannery stench was a physical wall, a reek of chemicals and decay that made the eyes water. And there, sitting on the very end with his legs dangling over, was a hunched figure.

Klaas was maybe sixteen, with a round, placid face and eyes that held the river’s constant movement. He didn’t startle as I approached. He just turned his head, his expression open as a child’s.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” he said, his voice soft. “It’s my place.”

“Jan sent me.”

At Jan’s name, his suspicion eased. “Oh. Do you like the water?”

“I need to use it. I need to get to a ship out in the stream. The big one, with the three masts.”

“The *Kroon*,” he said, nodding. “She’s heavy in the water. Sitting low. They’ve been loading her all week. At night.” He said it as simple fact, with no implied secrecy.

“Can you take me? In your skiff? When… when there’s a lot of noise and light from the refineries?”

He considered this, looking back at the river. “The current is tricky there. It pulls toward the dredging channel. You have to know how to use the eddy behind the chain-boat. Otherwise you’ll be swept past.” He stood up, brushing off his trousers. “I can show you the eddy.”

He led me to a tiny, tar-painted skiff tied to a rusted ring. It was beautifully kept, the oarlocks greased, the single pair of oars worn smooth by his hands. He didn’t ask why. He didn’t ask about the man’s coat, the tension in my shoulders. The river was his language, and my request was a phrase he understood.

We waited. The mist turned to a light, cold rain. The city sounds were muffled, distant. Then, a change. Not a sound at first, but a vibration in the air, a shift in the quality of the darkness to the east. A faint, orange glow bloomed above the rooftops, not the steady light of refinery furnaces, but a leaping, hungry illumination.

Shouts followed, distorted by distance into a single roar of anger. A bell began to clang, not the slow curfew bell, but the rapid, frantic alarm of the fire watch. The distraction was not a small fire. It was a riot.

Klaas looked toward the glow, his face calm. “That’s the noise,” he said.

“Yes.”

He untied the skiff, held it steady as I climbed in, my movements clumsy with a tension he did not share. He pushed us off with a single, expert shove against the pilings and slid the oars into the water. We moved into the blackness of the river, the sounds of the city fracturing into distinct waves of noise: the alarm bells, a deeper, booming crash that might have been a door being forced, the rising, unified chant of men’s voices.

Klaas rowed with an effortless, rhythmic grace, his eyes on the water, reading its surface like a page. He angled us not directly toward the *Zuiderkroon*, but upstream, letting the current catch us. The ship grew from a silhouette to a vast, wall-sided mass. Lanterns swung on its deck, revealing clusters of men at the rails, looking toward the commotion on shore. The distraction was holding.

“The eddy,” Klaas whispered, and with a few strong, silent pulls, he swung the skiff into a patch of strangely still water behind a moored dredge barge. The current wanted to pull us past the ship’s stern, but here, we hung, bobbing gently, hidden in the deeper shadow of the barge. We were amidships, just aft of the great, dark bulge of the hull that was hold seven.

A loading door was set into the ship’s side, about ten feet above the waterline. It was closed. A Jacob’s ladder, used for pilots, was rolled and secured beside it. My way in.

“I can’t hold here long,” Klaas murmured. “The eddy spits you out.”

I looked at the slick, black hull, at the small, distant rectangle of the door. It was impossible. A leap from a moving skiff, a climb with no proper handholds. The audacity he thought my gender incapable of. It was all I had.

I stripped off the heavy work coat, let it fall into the bilge. Underneath, I wore dark, close-fitting clothes I’d taken from the same line—a man’s shirt and trousers, rolled at the cuff. I tied the cap tighter on my head.

“When I jump, you go,” I said. “Don’t look back. Don’t wait.”

Klaas nodded. “The river will take you, if you fall.”

“I know.”

I waited for the skiff to rise on a small swell. As it neared the apex, I stood, my balance precarious. I focused on a rusted bolt-head just below the loading door. A tiny, imperfect handhold. I coiled my legs and pushed off.

The world became a violent lurch of motion. My fingers scraped across cold, wet iron, caught the bolt. My body slammed against the hull, the impact driving the air from my lungs in a silent gasp. I hung there, my feet scrambling against the slime-covered plates. I heard the soft, quick dip of Klaas’s oars as he pulled away, swallowed by the dark.

Above, the sounds of the ship were clearer: shouts of confusion, orders bellowed to keep men at their stations, to ignore the shore. They were looking landward. Not down.

I began to climb. It was a spider’s progress, finding cracks between plates, the heads of rivets, the lip of a scupper. Each grip was a gamble, each upward shift of weight a potential plunge into the waiting river. My muscles screamed, burned from the roof-fall, the running, the cold. The loading door was a mere arm’s length away. I stretched, my fingers finding the cold iron handle. It was dogged shut from the inside.

I hung there, pressed against the ship, the reality of my position crashing down. I was a barnacle on a leviathan. I had no tools, no plan beyond this point. The truth was inside, but I was stuck to the outside of its vault.

Then, a vibration through the iron. A deep, metallic *clunk* from within the hull, right behind the door. Machinery engaging. A winch. They were moving something. Preparing.

The handle above my head began to turn.

I froze, my blood turning to ice in my veins. The door was opening outward. It would swing out and knock me into the water. I had seconds.

I pushed sideways along the hull, fingers clawing for any purchase. I found the edge of the rolled Jacob’s ladder, the rough hemp of its ropes. As the loading door creaked open, a wedge of yellow lantern-light slicing the darkness, I hooked my arm through the ladder’s rungs and pulled my body tight against its roll, making myself part of the ship’s furniture.

The door swung open fully. A man stood silhouetted in the light, his face in shadow. He leaned out, looking toward the shore, the reflected glow of the distant riot dancing on his features. It was one of De Vries’s clerks, the nervous one from the office.

“Madness,” he muttered to someone inside. “The whole east end is alight. He says it changes nothing. We proceed.”

“The lighter is ready?” another voice asked from within.

“Almost. The crane is secured to the load. We just need the all-clear from the bridge. It’s chaos up there. Half the crew are gawping at the flames.”

He stayed there, leaning on the door frame, a sentry bored with his post. I hung beside him, close enough to see the stubble on his jaw, to smell the tobacco on his breath. My arm ached with the strain of holding still. A drop of water from my hair fell, landing on his hand resting on the door.

He looked at his hand, then up, directly at the rolled ladder.

His eyes met mine.

For a heartbeat that spanned an eternity, we stared at each other. His were wide with the slow-dawning horror of the impossible. A face from a burning office, now clinging to the side of his ship. A ghost made flesh, and dripping wet.

His mouth opened to cry out.

I moved. My free hand shot out, not for the door, but for the lantern he’d set on the deck just inside. I snatched it by its wire handle and swung it in a short, brutal arc. The glass shattered against the side of his head. The flame guttered and died on the wet iron. He crumpled without a sound, slumping over the door sill.

I hauled myself over him, into the hold.

The smell hit me first. It was not the smell of a ship’s hold—not of damp timber, or burlap, or spices. It was dry, and cold, and carried a faint, acrid tang of ozone and something else, something profoundly mineral, like the air deep inside a cave. The space was vast, lit by a few suspended lanterns. And it was not filled with crates or machinery.

It was a laboratory.

Long wooden tables ran the length of the hold, bolted to the deck. They were laden not with cargo, but with glassware: beakers, retorts, distillation coils of a complexity I’d only seen in engravings of alchemists’ dens. There were scales with weights of polished brass, notebooks stacked in precise piles, and jars containing powders and liquids of unnatural colors—a vivid, sickly green, a purple so deep it was almost black.

In the center of the space, secured to the deck by heavy iron brackets, was the source of the power he coveted.

It was a machine, but unlike any I had ever seen. It stood about eight feet tall, a construct of polished copper, glass cylinders, and thick, insulated cables that snaked away to a bank of monstrous chemical batteries. At its heart, contained within a glass sphere held in a cradle of copper claws, was a rock.

It was not a gem. It was rough, about the size of a man’s fist, and it glowed. Not with heat or reflected light, but with its own internal, pulsating radiance. A cold, blue-white light that throbbed like a slow, steady heartbeat. It cast sharp, dancing shadows through the hold. With each pulse, a faint, hair-raising crackle whispered from the machine, and the air tasted sharper, more metallic.

This was it. Not gold, not spices. Not a weapon, in the conventional sense. It was a source. A battery of unimaginable potency. De Vries wasn’t just cornering a market; he was trying to corner the future itself. The refineries, the shipping lanes, the political favors—they were all just the scaffolding to protect and exploit *this*. A piece of a star, fallen to earth and caged in glass.

“You.”

The voice came from the far end of the hold, near a secondary hatch. A man stepped from behind a bank of instrumentation. He was tall, gaunt, dressed not in sailor’s gear but in a stained leather apron over a fine shirt. His hands were long-fingered, delicate, stained with chemical burns. His eyes, magnified by thick spectacles, were fixed on me with a fanatic’s intensity. This was the mind, the alchemist. The keeper of the stone.

He held a heavy glass stirring rod like a club. “You are the disruption. The variable in the equation.”

I stood, the broken lantern handle still in my hand, water pooling at my feet. I was inside the vault. The truth was before me, humming with alien energy. But I was not alone with it.

“He’s terrified of anyone seeing this,” I said, my voice echoing strangely in the cavernous, charged space. “Why? What does it *do*?”

The alchemist’s lips stretched into a thin, proud smile. “It redefines *possible*. It is not a thing that *does*. It is a thing that *allows*. Light without flame. Motion without steam. A silent, clean, endless pulse of power.” His gaze was rapt upon the glowing stone. “He is terrified because he is a merchant. He understands control of a commodity. He does not understand a paradigm. And paradigms are harder to kill than people.”

Footsteps pounded on the deck above, urgent. Shouts filtered down. They had found the clerk at the door.

The alchemist’s smile vanished. He looked from the stone to me, and his fanaticism curdled into a cold, pragmatic fear. “You have seen it. That is enough. You must not leave. The equation must be balanced.”

He raised the glass rod and started toward me, not with a fighter’s grace, but with the grim determination of a man protecting his life’s work.

I backed away, my eyes scanning the tables. The truth was here, dazzling and terrible. But the vault had become a cage. And the keeper of the truth was coming to silence the witness, his spectacles gleaming in the cold, pulsating light of the stone that promised a new world, and had made this one a hunting ground.

## **Chapter 21**

The glass rod came down not with a fighter’s swing, but with the terrible, efficient arc of a butcher’s cleaver. It was meant to split my skull, to end the equation. I threw myself sideways, the movement a wet, graceless stumble. The rod whistled past my ear and struck the edge of the iron table with a crystalline *pang* that shivered up into my teeth. A long, wicked shard spun away into the shadows.

The alchemist—no, the *technician*, the *keeper*—blinked behind his spectacles, surprised by the resistance of matter. His world was one of theory and luminous potential. Mine was one of grease-slick floors and the immediate, pressing need to not have my brains spilled.

I came up with the broken lantern handle reversed in my grip, the splintered end a crude spike. The water from my clothes had spread around me, a dark halo on the stone. He adjusted his grip on the rod, the remaining length a jagged club. His eyes flickered past me, to the stone. Its light pulsed, a slow, patient heartbeat that painted the cavern in waves of cold blue and deep, velvety shadow. It was watching. Or it felt like it was watching.

“You don’t have to do his killing,” I said, my voice low, measured against the hum. “A man like Visser understands a knife, a debt, a threat. This?” I jerked my chin toward the stone. “This is a god. You don’t serve it by being his street-corner thug.”

His lips, thin and bloodless, tightened. “You reduce it to metaphor. It is not a god. It is a key. And he holds the door.” He took a step, his leather apron creaking. “You are a loose thread. You unravel things.”

Above us, the pounding became a thunder. A heavy object slammed against the vault door—a ram, maybe, or a shoulder fueled by panic. The clerk’s body wouldn’t hold them long. The keeper heard it too. A tic jumped beneath his eye. His sanctuary was breached. The pure math of his work was now corrupted by the messy variables of men with clubs and questions.

He lunged again. This time the rod came in a sideways sweep, aiming for my ribs. I didn’t try to block it; glass against iron-shod wood was a losing proposition. I stepped inside the swing, into the space his fanaticism had left empty. The world narrowed to the smell of his chemicals—sour ammonia, sharp ozone—and the magnified, frantic blue of his eyes behind their lenses.

I drove the splintered end of the lantern handle into the meat of his thigh.

It was not a deep wound. The wood was rough, not sharp. But it was a shock. A violation of his clinical space. He gasped, a sound of profound indignation, and stumbled back, his free hand going to the puncture in his leather apron. A dark bloom spread, not from the shallow stab, but from the broken glass still embedded in the rod’s end, which had raked his own palm. He stared at the blood, his own, with a kind of detached curiosity.

The door above groaned. A sharp, metallic *crack* echoed down the shaft. They were through the lock.

The keeper’s gaze snapped from his hand to me, to the stone, then to the spiral stairs. The calculus in his head was visible: the specimen, the witness, the invaders. The specimen was paramount. The witness was a contaminant. The invaders were a tide.

He made his choice. With a snarl that held more anguish than anger, he hurled the glass rod at my head. I ducked, and it shattered against a bank of copper coils with a sound like falling chimes. Then he turned and ran, not for the stairs, but deeper into the vault, toward a smaller, iron-banded door I hadn’t seen, half-hidden behind a rack of ceramic batteries humming with captured light.

He was abandoning his creation. Or he was trusting it to be a harder secret to steal than a man.

I didn’t chase him. The truth wasn’t in the man. It was here, thrumming in the air, making the fillings in my teeth ache. The door at the top of the stairs burst open. Boots on metal, shouting. Visser’s voice, raw with a fury that was mostly fear, cut through the din. “Find her! Kill her! Nothing else matters!”

They thought the stone was just a jewel, a prize. They didn’t feel its pulse in their marrow.

I looked at the stone on its pedestal. The alchemist’s words echoed. *A thing that allows.* It was a heart. A silent, beating heart for a machine not yet built. To take it would be to claim a kingdom. To leave it was to leave a weapon in the hands of a frightened, greedy man.

But I was not a thief of kingdoms. I was a finder of secrets. And a secret seen is a secret halved.

I moved. Not toward the stone, but toward the nearest worktable. My hands, slick with canal water and now a smear of the keeper’s blood, swept across its surface. I wasn’t looking for tools. I was looking for notes. The scrawl of genius. I snatched up a leather-bound journal, its pages thick with diagrams and cramped, frantic script. I shoved it inside my coat, against my ribs. It was a cold, hard rectangle of truth.

A heavy glass beaker stood next to a rack of vials. I grabbed it, hefted its weight. Then I turned and threw it, not at the men now clattering down the stairs, but at the stone’s pedestal.

It was a terrible shot. I wasn’t aiming to hit the stone itself—the thought of what that impact might do curdled my blood—but at the base. The beaker struck the iron support with a crash. Glass and a clear, viscous fluid exploded. The fluid hit the cables snaking from the stone’s base. For a heartbeat, nothing.

Then the stone flared.

It wasn’t a pulse. It was a silent, blinding detonation of blue-white light. It etched the bones of my hands against my eyelids. It bleached the color from the world, turning everything to stark negative: black shadows, white edges. A wave of force, not heat but a profound, shoving pressure, slammed into my chest. It lifted me off my feet and threw me back against the iron table. My breath left me in a grunt of pure shock.

The men on the stairs cried out—not in pain, but in primal terror. The light was wrong. It was a color that had no business in the belly of a barge. It was the light of a cold, new sun.

The glare died as suddenly as it had bloomed, collapsing back into the stone’s core, but its afterimage danced in my vision like a ghost. The hum had changed. It was higher now, strained, a wire vibrating near its breaking point. Thin tendrils of smoke rose from the scorched cables at the pedestal’s base.

I pushed myself up, my ears ringing in the new silence. The keeper’s door hung open, a black rectangle. He was gone. On the stairs, three of Visser’s men were frozen, clutching the railing, their faces masks of superstitious dread. They had come down for a woman, a fight in the dark. They had found a silent, screaming star.

Visser stood behind them, at the top of the stairs. The unnatural light had hollowed his face, made his eyes into dark pits. He wasn’t looking at me. He was staring at the stone, now flickering erratically, like a heart in arrhythmia. His treasure was broken. Or waking up. He couldn’t tell which, and the not-knowing was a torture worse than any threat I could pose.

“Get it,” he whispered, the command carrying in the dead air. “Get it under cover. Now.”

His men didn’t move. They were sailors, used to wind and wave and the tangible violence of knives. This was a witchcraft that stripped them of their courage.

I used their paralysis. While they stared at the dying light, I moved toward the only other exit: the keeper’s door. I kept low, behind the tables, my wet clothes making no sound on the stone. The journal pressed against my side, a stolen bible of this new, terrible faith.

One of the men, younger, with a weal of a fresh burn across his cheek, finally shook himself. He saw my movement. “Boss,” he hissed.

Visser’s gaze snapped to me. The fear in his eyes crystallized into a hatred so pure it was almost clean. I had seen. I had broken. I had to be erased, not just killed, but unmade from the history of this moment. “Her,” he said, the word flat and final. “Just her.”

The younger man came down the last of the stairs, drawing a long, tar-stained knife from his belt. The other two, galvanized by a command they understood, followed. The stone was forgotten. I was a human problem, and they had human solutions.

I reached the small door and slipped through, into darkness. A narrow corridor, hewn from the ship’s timbers, smelling of damp rot and chemical runoff. I pulled the door shut behind me. There was no lock, only a simple latch. It wouldn’t hold them.

I ran. The corridor sloped upward, following the curve of the hull. Pipes hissed overhead. Somewhere ahead, water dripped in a steady, maddening rhythm. My breath sawed in my throat, the earlier exhaustion now a lead weight in my limbs. The coat was a sodden beast on my shoulders, the journal a slab of stone.

The door behind me crashed open. Boots pounded in the passage. They didn’t shout. They were hunting now, and silence was the tool.

The corridor ended at a T-junction. To the left, a faint, greasy yellow glow suggested a working area, maybe the keeper’s private lab. To the right, pitch black, and a cooler draft carrying the smell of the canal. The way out.

I went right.

The darkness was absolute. I kept one hand on the rough, wet timber of the wall, the other extended ahead, feeling for obstacles. The draft grew stronger. Ahead, a faint, grey suggestion of light—a grating, perhaps, or a hatch. Freedom, or a trap.

A shape loomed out of the dark to my left, a deeper blackness. I sensed more than saw the movement, the shift of air. I dropped to a crouch. The knife swished through the space where my neck had been, striking the wall with a solid *thunk*. The younger man. He’d found a parallel passage, or he knew the maze better than I did.

I didn’t rise. I scissored my legs out, sweeping his feet from under him. He went down with a choked curse, the knife skittering away. I was on him before he could draw breath, my knees pinning his shoulders, my hands finding his face in the dark. I didn’t punch. I pressed my thumbs hard into his eyes, not to blind, but to panic. He bucked, gagging, his hands clawing at my wrists. I held the pressure for a count of two, then released and rolled off, snatching for the knife. My fingers closed on the hilt.

He was scrambling back, whimpering, his hands to his face. I stood, the knife in my hand. The other two were close; I could hear their cautious steps in the main corridor.

The grey light was stronger now. Ten paces ahead was a heavy iron grate, covering a circular opening in the hull. Moonlight and the reflected gaslights of the dock filtered through, illuminating a small, empty space—a dry storage locker, now abandoned. The grate was held by four large, rusted wingnuts.

I sheathed the knife in my belt and went to work. The first nut turned with a shriek of metal. The second was frozen solid. I drew the knife again, using the pommel as a hammer, beating at the stubborn wing until it sheared off with a crack. The noise was catastrophic in the confined space.

“Here!” a voice shouted from behind me. A lantern’s beam swung around the corner, blinding me.

I threw my weight against the grate. With two bolts gone, it held for a second, then buckled outward with a groan. I squeezed through the gap, splinters tearing at my coat, and tumbled out onto a narrow, slimy ledge just above the waterline of the barge. The canal was a black mirror below, stinking and cold.

The locker was on the barge’s far side, away from the dock. Across the water, maybe fifteen feet, was the pitted stone wall of the opposite quay, the foundations of a warehouse. No ladder. No rope.

A head thrust through the grate behind me. A hand, holding a pistol, wavered in the moonlight.

I didn’t think. I jumped.

The water was a physical agony, a shock that stopped my heart for a beat before it began hammering against my ribs. It was not the clean, cold shock of the sea. This was a thick, gelid stew of filth and winter. My coat, the journal inside it, became an anchor. I fought the instinct to thrash, to gasp. I kicked, driving downward, away from the surface light, following the curve of the barge’s hull.

The pistol shot, when it came, was a muffled, watery *thump*. The bullet tore a line of bubbles past my shoulder, spent and harmless. I swam, my lungs burning, my hands scraping against slimy stone and submerged timber. I counted. Ten strokes. Twenty.

My head broke the surface in the deep shadow between the barge and a neighboring coal hulk. I sucked in air that tasted of tar and decay, the sound masked by the lap of water against hulls. I treaded water, listening.

Voices, angry and confused, carried from the deck of Visser’s barge. A lantern beam swept the water where I’d jumped. It didn’t reach my hiding place.

I had to move. The cold was leaching the strength from my bones, turning my muscles to sluggish clay. I let the current, sluggish as it was, carry me down the length of the coal hulk. At its stern, I found a mooring chain, a thick, slimy serpent leading up to the quay. I hauled myself out, hand over hand, the links biting into my frozen palms. Every pull was a separate universe of effort.

I collapsed onto the cobbles behind a stack of empty crates, vomiting a gout of canal water. My body shook uncontrollably, a violent, ceaseless tremor. I was a thing of mud and ice. But the journal was still there, a solid block of damning evidence pressed against my shuddering heart.

I needed to get off the docks. Visser’s men would be fanning out, checking every shadow. He couldn’t let me live now. I had seen the core of his power, and I had made it sick. I had the book. I was a vector for his ruin.

Pushing myself up, I staggered into the maze of alleys behind the warehouses. I moved from pool of darkness to pool of darkness, a creature of the in-between places. The grand houses of the Herengracht felt a world away. Jan’s bar was a memory of warmth I might never feel again. I had nowhere to go. The stone’s cold light was seared behind my eyes, and the keeper’s words were a chant in my head. *A thing that allows.*

I understood now, in my marrow. Visser wasn’t just a thief or a profiteer. He was a man trying to bottle lightning, to sell silence, to own the future. And he would burn the present to the ground to keep it.

A figure detached itself from a doorway ahead, blocking the narrow passage. Tall, lean. Not one of Visser’s bruisers. The moonlight caught the fine wool of his coat, the pale gleam of his face.

Rafael.

He didn’t speak. He simply looked at me, dripping and shaking in the alley filth. His expression was unreadable. Not surprise. Not pity. A kind of weary recognition, as if he’d been waiting for me to arrive at this exact, desperate point.

“They’re hunting you,” he said, his voice quiet. It wasn’t a question.

I nodded, my teeth chattering too hard to form words.

He glanced back the way I’d come, then at the sky, judging the hour. “He’s pulled men from the watch. Paid for silence. The docks are his for the next few hours.” He stepped closer. The scent of him—soap and clean linen—was a brutal contrast to the reek of the canal on my skin. “You have something he wants. More than your life.”

I clutched my coat tighter over the journal. “You work for him.”

“I work for the city,” he corrected, his tone flinty. “He is a cyst upon it. I thought he could be lanced with careful pressure. You have taken a sledgehammer to it.” He sighed, the sound full of a profound fatigue. “Now it will rupture. And poison everything.”

He reached out a hand. Not to take the journal. To steady me. His grip was firm, warm through my soaked sleeve. “You cannot go to ground. He owns the ground. You cannot run. He will close the gates.”

“Then what?” I managed, the words slurred with cold.

He looked at me, and in his eyes I saw not the polished functionary, but the man who walked the knife-edge between law and survival. “You give him what he wants. But not on his terms. You force the rupture on your ground. You show the cyst to the light.”

He was talking about a confrontation. A public one. It was madness.

“He’ll kill me,” I said.

“Yes,” Rafael agreed, without hesitation. “He will try. But he is a merchant. He understands an auction. A trade.” His gaze dropped to the bulge of the journal beneath my coat. “You have the manifest. You offer it back. In exchange for a hearing. In front of people he cannot buy, or cannot afford to kill.”

“Who?”

“The men whose money built that stone,” he said. “The syndicate. They are not all in his pocket. Some are… nervous. About his methods. About the attention.” He meant the deaths. The disappearances. The clerk with his throat cut. Me, hunted through the streets. “They meet tomorrow night. At the *Koning van Denemarken*. A private room. He will be there, to reassure them.”

The most powerful men in the city. I would be a mouse walking into a council of cats.

“They’ll side with him,” I said. “Money sides with money.”

“Perhaps,” Rafael conceded. “But they are also men who hate a mess. You are a mess. He has failed to clean you up. That makes him look weak. And in their world, weakness is the only sin.” He released my arm. “It is the only move you have left, Els. Stand in the light where he cannot simply make you vanish. Make your accusation. Show your proof. And hope the stink of his failure is stronger than the glitter of his gold.”

He was offering me a path, but it was a path across a tightrope, over a pit of wolves. He was not my ally. He was a man steering a crisis toward an outcome that might, incidentally, save his city.

“Why?” I asked, the single word hanging in the cold air between us.

For the first time, something like emotion touched his face. A faint, grim twist of the lips. “Because I, too, have seen what that stone can do. Not its light. What it does to the men who hold it. It makes them see people as… variables. To be balanced out.” He met my eyes. “I find I do not care for the equation.”

He turned and gestured for me to follow. “There is a place you can dry out. A safe place. For tonight.”

I hesitated. This could be the trap. The neat, final solution.

But the cold was in my core now. The trembling was becoming a dangerous lethargy. I had no other cards to play. I was a variable he had not yet balanced.

I took a step, then another, following Rafael’s silhouette into the deeper darkness of the alley. The journal was a lead weight. The stone’s dying light was a ghost in my mind. And ahead, in the warm, wood-paneled room of a gentlemen’s club, a different kind of machine awaited—one of money, power, and polished lies. I would have to walk into its gears and trust that my truth, ugly and dripping with canal water, was a wrench solid enough to jam them all.

# Chapter 22

## **Chapter 22**

The safe place was a room above a printer’s shop in the Jordaan. It smelled of ink, cheap paper, and the ghost of old tobacco. Rafael left me there with a key, a loaf of black bread, and a warning that felt like a seal being set on a tomb.

“Be at *De Witte Olifant* at eight tomorrow. Ask for the *Zeeuwse Kamer*. They will bring you up. Do not be late. Do not be early. Wear something that does not look like you pulled it from a bin.”

He did not wait for an answer. The door clicked shut, and I heard the solid turn of a second lock in the hall. A courtesy, or a containment. The room held a narrow bed, a washstand with a chipped pitcher, a single chair. A window looked out onto a dark canal, the opposite house leaning close enough to touch. It was a cell with a view.

I set the journal on the bed. My coat steamed in the room’s dry heat, releasing the smell of the city’s underbelly. I peeled it off, then the wet wool of my sweater, my fingers clumsy and numb. The cold had migrated inward, settling in the marrow of my bones. I poured water from the pitcher—it was clean, shockingly so—and scrubbed at my face, my neck, the grime of the warehouse and the canal. The face in the small, spotted mirror was a stranger’s. Pale. Eyes too dark, set in bruise-colored sockets. A mouth that had forgotten any shape but a line.

I was a mess. That was my value. My only weapon.

I slept then, a black and dreamless plunge, and woke to the gray, pre-dawn light seeping between the buildings. The trembling was gone, replaced by a hollow, resonant stillness. I felt like a shell. I ate some of the bread. It was dense, sour. It tasted of nothing.

The clothes Rafael had implied I needed were folded on the chair. A simple, dark wool dress, slightly too large, but clean. Stockings. Sturdy, polished shoes that pinched at the heel. The uniform of a respectable, anonymous woman. Dressing in them was an act of camouflage. I tucked the journal into a deep pocket sewn inside the skirt, its weight a familiar pendulum against my thigh.

The hours until eight were a desert. I sat by the window and watched the canal come to life. A barge moved past, loaded with barrels. A woman across the way shook a rug from a window. A cat picked its way along a gutter. Ordinary life, moving with the blind, persistent rhythm of ants. I was outside of it, a speck of grit about to be dropped into a watchworks.

*De Witte Olifant* was on the Herengracht, a fortress of wealth behind a severe, classical façade. Its windows were tall, clean, and blank. I arrived as the bells were striking eight, my borrowed shoes silent on the swept cobbles. The door was opened by a man in a black coat whose eyes took me in, dismissed me, and then flickered with a faint surprise when I spoke.

“The *Zeeuwse Kamer*.”

He stepped back without a word. The interior was a hushed world of dark wood, worn leather, and the sweet, dusty smell of old money. Portraits of stern men in ruffs looked down from the walls. The carpet swallowed sound. My presence here was a dissonant note, a stain on the harmony. The man led me up a wide staircase, down a corridor lined with closed doors, and stopped before one of polished oak. He knocked once, opened it, and gestured me inside.

The room was a library. Shelves of leather-bound books rose to the ceiling. A fire crackled in a marble hearth, and the air was thick with the scent of cigar smoke, brandy, and beeswax. Four men were arranged in high-backed chairs. They did not rise.

Visser sat nearest the fire, one leg crossed over the other, a glass of amber liquid in his hand. He looked like he had been carved from the same wood as the furniture, polished to a hard, impermeable sheen. His eyes met mine, and there was nothing in them. No anger, no recognition. I was a document to be reviewed.

The other three I knew by reputation, if not by sight. De Wit, the shipping magnate, his face a roadmap of burst capillaries. Van Dijk, who owned half the warehouses north of the IJ. And Scholten, the banker, small and precise as a watchmaker, his fingers steepled before his lips.

A fifth chair, straight-backed and unwelcoming, sat empty facing them. My place.

Rafael stood by the window, his back to the room, looking out at the canal as if the proceedings were of no interest to him. He was the guarantor of this audience. The moderator. Or the executioner.

“Sit,” said De Wit, his voice a gravel rumble.

I sat. The chair was hard. I kept my hands in my lap, over the hidden weight of the journal. I did not look away from them.

Visser took a slow sip of his drink. “Gentlemen. This is the woman I mentioned. Els. Formerly in my employ. She has, I am given to understand, some… grievances she wishes to air.” He said the word *grievances* as if it were a childish thing, a tantrum.

“We are busy men,” Van Dijk said, his gaze cool and assessing. “This is highly irregular.”

“It is,” Visser agreed. “But Rafael felt it prudent. To avoid… further public disturbances.” He shifted his eyes to me. “Speak, then. You have stolen from me. Conspired against me. You have made accusations to the wrong people. Here are the right people. Say your piece.”

It was a masterful opening. He had framed me before I could utter a word. A thief. A hysteric. I was not a victim bringing a charge; I was a problem being managed.

The silence stretched. The fire popped. I could feel the pressure of their collective gaze, a physical weight. They were not cats. Cats had passion, curiosity. These men were stones. Smoothed by the flow of money and power until all that remained was inertia and mass.

I did not speak to Visser. I looked at De Wit, then Van Dijk, then Scholten.

“My name is Els. I was a diver for Mijnheer Visser. I retrieved things for him from the mud. Two months ago, I retrieved a stone. A blue stone. From the wreck of the *Zwarte Zee*.”

Scholten’s steepled fingers twitched. Van Dijk’s eyes narrowed a fraction.

“I was instructed to bring it directly to him. I did. He took it to his workshop. That night, a man named Pieter, his metallurgist, was killed. His throat was cut. The official report called it a robbery.” My voice was flat, dry. It echoed strangely in the opulent room. “I was curious. I went back to the wreck. I found a body, wedged in the timbers. A man, dressed in fine clothes, not sailor’s gear. He had been dead a long time. He had a journal on him.”

Visser’s expression did not change. He swirled his brandy.

“The journal was written by a Portuguese alchemist. He was on the *Zwarte Zee*. He called the stone the *Luz do Abismo*. The Light of the Abyss. He wrote about what it could do. What it was for. It wasn’t treasure. It was a key. A battery. It could store… potential. Energy. A man’s life force. His will.” I was parroting terms I barely understood, but the words from the journal had seared themselves into my mind. “The alchemist was afraid. The ship’s captain, a man named Hendriks, had taken the stone. He believed it could make him powerful. Invincible. The last entry says the alchemist heard screaming from the captain’s cabin. Then the ship struck the reef and went down.”

I pulled the journal from my pocket. The water-stained, leather-bound book was a stark, ugly object in the refined room. I held it up. “It’s all here.”

“A fascinating story,” Visser said, his tone bored. “A shipwreck mystery. And you believe this… fairy tale… connects to me?”

“Pieter connected it,” I said, turning to him at last. “He was trying to understand the stone. You were helping him. Then he was dead. And you had the stone locked away, experimenting. You found a use for it. Not to store a life. To drain it.”

Van Dijk leaned forward. “Drain it.”

“To power a machine,” I said. “A loom. A prototype. One that doesn’t need a river, or steam, or a room full of women to run it. One that runs on… this.” I tapped the journal. “On will. On focus. On the thing it pulls out of a person when they are hooked to it. You used a girl. A beggar girl from the docks. You used her until there was nothing left. I found her body. In the canal behind your warehouse.”

For the first time, a ripple went through the room. De Wit shifted in his chair. Scholten’s lips pursed. A dead magnate from a centuries-old wreck was one thing. A dead beggar girl in a modern canal was another. It was messy. It was local.

Visser set his glass down with a soft, definitive click. “This is slander of the most grotesque kind. You have produced a fictional journal and the corpse of an unfortunate urchin. You are clearly unwell. Grief-stricken over your colleague, perhaps. Or simply ambitious. You seek to damage me. For what? More money?”

He was so calm. So reasonable. He turned to the others. “Gentlemen, I brought you here to dispel this nonsense. The stone is a curiosity. A piezoelectric oddity I am studying for potential applications in timekeeping. The girl’s death is a tragedy, but it has nothing to do with me. This woman is a disgruntled former employee, collaborating with elements in the city who wish to see my new manufactory fail.” His gaze slid to Rafael’s back by the window. “She is a pawn. And this is a waste of our time.”

The balance was tipping. I could see it in their faces. Visser’s narrative was clean, efficient. Mine was a gothic horror story, dripping with mud and madness. They were men of ledgers and tonnage. The supernatural was bad business.

I stood up. The movement was abrupt. It broke the rhythm of the room.

“It’s not a story,” I said, my voice low but sharp. “It’s a machine. And he’s building it. Bigger. He doesn’t want to power a single loom. He wants to power a factory. A city. And he’ll need more than beggar girls for that. He’ll need a source. A strong source.”

I looked at each of them. “You think you’re safe. You think your money, your walls, your names protect you. But you’re just a different kind of fuel to him. You’re a variable. And when he balances his equation, you’ll be factored in. Or out.”

Scholten spoke, his voice a dry rustle. “You are speaking in hysterics, woman.”

“Am I?” I took a step toward Visser. He didn’t flinch. “Where is the stone now, Mijnheer Visser? In your workshop? In your safe? Or is it already in the new foundation, the one you’re pouring for the mill on the Amstel? The one that will never need a coal bill? The one that will out-produce every other concern in the city? The one that will make you not just rich, but indispensable?”

That landed. I saw it hit. The mill on the Amstel was Visser’s open secret, his next great leap. A project on a scale that required their collective investment, their silent approval. I had aimed the wrench, and I had struck metal.

Visser’s polish finally cracked. A thin, vertical line appeared between his brows. “You have been poking around where you do not belong.”

“Someone has to,” I said. “Since the police see only what you pay them to see.”

Rafael turned from the window. He did not look at me. He addressed the room. “The accusation is specific. The journal exists. The girl’s body exists. The connection to Pieter’s death is circumstantial, but persistent.” He paused, letting the words settle. “And there is the matter of the stone itself. I have seen it. Its properties are… unnatural. Mijnheer Visser’s research into its application has been pursued with unusual secrecy. For a mere timekeeping device.”

He was not siding with me. He was stating facts. But in this room, facts were weapons.

Visser stood. He was taller than I remembered. The firelight cast his shadow, long and grasping, across the bookshelves. “This is absurd. You would take the word of this… this dredged-up creature… over mine? Based on a madman’s diary and the fantasies of a jealous rival?” His eyes burned at Rafael.

“I would see the stone,” Van Dijk said quietly. “This *Luz* thing. I would see this machine. The small one. The loom.”

“As would I,” said De Wit, crossing his arms over his broad chest.

It was a check. Not a checkmate. They were not convinced of my truth, but they were now uncertain of his. The stink of failure, of mess, was in the air.

Visser’s jaw tightened. He smoothed his waistcoat, a quick, violent gesture. “It is in a secure location. For study.”

“Then we will go to it,” Scholten said. “Now. We will all go. We will see this wonder, or this fraud, for ourselves.”

Panic, cold and bright, flashed in Visser’s eyes for a single, unguarded moment. It was the first real emotion I had seen from him. It was more telling than any confession. The stone was not somewhere he could show them. Not in its current state. Not with what it was doing.

“That is not possible today,” he said, his voice strained.

“Why not?” I pressed. “Is it busy? Is it… feeding?”

The word hung in the cigar-scented air. Ugly. Primitive.

Visser looked from one man to the next. He saw the doubt hardening into decision. His authority, that invisible currency, was bleeding away. He turned his fury on me, pure and undiluted.

“You,” he hissed. “You think you have won something? You have won nothing. You are a dead woman walking. You always have been. From the moment you pulled that stone from the mud, you were a spent match. A used rag.”

He took a step toward me. The men in their chairs did not move. Rafael watched, impassive.

“You want to see the machine?” Visser’s voice dropped to a venomous whisper. “You want to understand what it can do? Fine. Come to the Amstel site. Tonight. Midnight. Come and see the future. Come and see what happens to variables that have outlived their usefulness.”

It was an invitation to an execution. Everyone in the room knew it.

But it was also a capitulation. He was abandoning the field of polite lies. He was moving the battle to ground of his choosing, where the rules were written in violence.

He straightened, regaining his composure like a man adjusting a cuff. He nodded to the others, a stiff, formal gesture. “Gentlemen. I apologize for this spectacle. The matter will be settled. Cleanly. You have my word.”

He did not look at me again. He walked to the door, opened it, and was gone. His footsteps faded down the hall.

The silence he left behind was thick and charged. De Wit cleared his throat. Van Dijk stared into the fire. Scholten began to make a note in a small book, his pen scratching loudly.

Rafael moved from the window. “Gentlemen. I believe the audience is concluded.”

They rose, one by one, gathering their coats and hats. They filed out without a word to me. I had been the catalyst for a reaction, and now I was the residue left behind. The door closed, leaving me alone with Rafael.

He finally looked at me. His face was tired. “You got what you wanted. Their doubt. His rage.”

“It’s a trap,” I said.

“Of course it is.”

“You won’t interfere.”

“I cannot. Not directly. He has challenged you. You have accepted. The city’s… equilibrium… now depends on the outcome.” He picked up Visser’s abandoned brandy glass, looked at it, set it down. “He will have the stone there. And the machine. It will be fully realized. He will use it to demonstrate his power. And to eliminate you.”

“So I shouldn’t go.”

He gave me a thin, humorless smile. “If you do not go, you are admitting your accusations are lies. He will be vindicated. The investors will return to him. And he will have you killed anyway, at his leisure. You have forced the crisis, Els. Now you must see it through.”

I knew he was right. The tightrope was gone. There was only the pit.

“What is the machine?” I asked. “What has he built?”

Rafael’s gaze grew distant. “I have only heard whispers. From men who drank too much and woke up afraid of what they’d said. It is not a loom. Not anymore. It is a heart. He is building a mechanical heart for his new mill, and the stone is its chamber. It does not just draw power from a single life. It resonates. It pulls from… proximity. From attention. From the collective will of those around it. A factory full of workers, focused on their tasks, their worries, their small lives… it would feed on that. A slow, perpetual harvest. He calls it the *Eendracht*. The Concord. Harmony.” He looked at me. “A harmony where every soul is a note, and he is the only one who hears the music.”

The horror of it was so vast it felt cold. It wasn’t murder. It was farming.

“And tonight?”

“Tonight, he will have a test subject. Someone with a strong will. A defiant spirit. To prime it. To ignite the process.” He didn’t need to say who that subject would be. “If it works… the proof of concept will be undeniable. The men who were here today will fund him. They will not care about the source of the power. They will only care that it is theirs.”

I walked to the fireplace, holding my hands out to the flames. They were steady. The hollow stillness inside me had filled with a clear, cold substance. Like the *jenever* Jan served. Potent. Inflammable.

“I have to break it,” I said.

“You have to try.”

I turned to face him. “You ‘find you do not care for the equation.’ But you won’t lift a finger to stop it.”

“I am lifting you,” he said simply. “It is all I can do. The city is a machine, too, Els. More complex than his. I work within its gears. To reach in and grab his would tear the whole mechanism apart. There would be chaos. Fires in the street. The kind of mess that gets everyone killed.” He stepped closer, his voice dropping. “But a single, determined variable, introduced at the precise point of failure… that can jam a single machine. Without collapsing the whole.”

It was a cold calculus. My life for a chance to stop his. A fair trade, in the economy of power.

I nodded. I understood the game now. I had never left the water. I was just in deeper, the pressure crushing, the light gone. All that was left was to swim toward the only thing I could feel: the cold, blue pulse of the stone, and the darker shadow of the man who wielded it.

“I’ll need a weapon,” I said.

Rafael reached into his coat and placed a small, heavy object on the table beside the brandy glass. It was a diver’s knife. A good one. The blade was short, thick, and cruelly sharp. The handle was worn smooth from use.

“It was Pieter’s,” he said. “He was a sentimental man. He kept it after he left the docks. For luck.”

I picked it up. The handle fit my palm as if it had been waiting there. It had no luck in it. Only purpose.

“Midnight,” I said.

“The Amstel site. The main foundation pit.” He moved to the door. “Good luck, Els. The city will not thank you. But I will remember the equation.”

Then he was gone, and I was alone with the dying fire, the ghost of cigar smoke, and the weight of the knife in my hand. The journal was still on the chair. I left it there. Its words had done their work. Now it was down to the language of blood, and steel, and a stone that drank the light from the world.

I looked out the window. The day was bright and cold. The city gleamed, a beautiful, heartless machine. I had until midnight to walk through its gears one last time, to the place where its new, hungry heart was waiting to beat.

# Chapter 23

## **Chapter 23**

The day was a lie. The cold, bright sun that glinted off the canal belts and made the gabled facades look like polished bone was a stage-light. It illuminated a city playing itself, a beautiful, intricate deception. I walked through it, a ghost in the machinery. The weight of Pieter’s knife was a secret gravity in the deep pocket of my coat, pulling me down through the cheerful bustle of the Leidsestraat, past the flower stalls with their defiant winter blooms, into the narrower, quieter streets that led toward the river.

I was a variable. A single, determined variable. Rafael’s cold calculus echoed in the rhythm of my steps. I understood the terms. My life was the coefficient. The outcome was the jam in Van der Meer’s machine. A fair trade. But fairness was a ledger for men who balanced books, not for women who balanced on the knife-edge between the gutter and the grave. I had walked that edge so long the drop was a familiar companion. Tonight, I would either fall or I would learn to fly on the thermals of the explosion.

My feet carried me without conscious direction. Not toward the Amstel site, not yet. The hours until midnight were a vast, empty plain I had to cross. I found myself on the Keizersgracht, stopping before a tall, narrow house with green shutters. My sister’s house. The curtains were drawn in the front parlor. A pram stood by the door, empty. A life contained within clean walls, defined by the cries of a child and the expectations of a husband. A life that had once been mine to grasp, if I had been willing to soften my edges, to smile at the right men, to trade my suspicion for security.

I had chosen the damp wool and the smell of fryer grease. I had chosen the calculating glances in *De Visser*, the currency of subtle teeth. I had chosen the deep, dark water. Looking at that pram, I felt no regret, only a colder, clearer certainty. Her world, with its rules written in invitations and gossip, was a machine, too. Just a quieter one. Its gears were made of suggestion and exclusion, and it crushed souls just as efficiently, it just left less visible blood. At least in my world, the threats were honest. A knife was a knife. A man’s greed was a naked, ugly thing. You could see it coming.

A shadow moved behind the glass of the door. I turned and walked away before it could resolve into my sister’s face, before I could see the pity or the fear or the quiet disapproval that was her own kind of weapon. I had no place there. I was a toxin in that clean system.

The afternoon bled away in a series of aimless circuits. I bought a bitter coffee from a stall and drank it standing against a wall, watching the city move. The men in their dark coats and tall hats, talking of shipments and shares. The women with their baskets and their guarded eyes. The whole dance was a complex pressure system, and I was a sudden, low pocket, a silence in the hum. I saw a young maid, barely more than a girl, being berated by a shopkeeper for a chipped jug. Her face was a mask of terrified submission, but her hands, clenched white at her sides, told a different story. A story of a variable waiting for its moment. I gave her a single, slow nod as I passed. Her eyes flicked to mine, wide with surprise, then dropped again. But her shoulders straightened, just a fraction. A seed. Planted in barren soil, perhaps. But planted.

As dusk began to stain the sky the color of a fresh bruise, I knew where I had to go. Not to prepare, but to remember. To anchor myself in the deep, dark water from which I’d come.

The docks were the city’s exposed sinew. Here, the machine wasn’t hidden behind lace curtains and polite conversation. It roared. It stank of tar and rotting fish and the sour sweat of labor. The cranes were frozen black skeletons against the purple sky. The water in the basins was thick, sluggish, oil-slicked. This was the engine room. And I had been a cog here once. A small, silent one, but a part of the grind.

I walked to the end of the Westelijke Eilanden pier, where the wind came sharp and unfettered off the IJ. The cold needled through my coat, the same precise, hateful cold as the rain on the night this began. I stood where my father had often stood, looking out at the endless, flat grey where the water met the cloud. He’d come here to think, he said. To feel the size of the world beyond the canals.

I took the knife from my pocket. Pieter’s knife. I pulled the blade from its leather sheath. The metal was dull in the twilight, but the edge, when I tested it with my thumb, was a line of pure, potential violence. A sentimental man, Rafael had said. He kept it for luck.

But sentiment was a luxury for the safe. For men who could afford to keep trophies of a past life. For my father, for Pieter, a knife was a tool. It cut rope, pried open crates, cleaned fish. It was an extension of the hand, for work. For a woman alone, walking into a foundation pit to face a man with a stone that drank light, a knife was not a tool. It was a last, desperate argument. It was the final, sharp punctuation to a life of questions.

A voice, rough with phlegm and cheap gin, slithered out of the shadows of a stacked pallet. “That’s a pretty piece. A bit big for the likes of you, isn’t it, *meisje*?”

I didn’t turn. I kept looking at the water, my fingers tightening on the handle. I knew the type. The docks had its own ecosystem of predators, the ones who couldn’t even hack it as stevedores, who fed on the weaker strays. I was a woman alone. I was a provocation.

“I said,” the voice came closer, boots scraping on the wet stone. “That’s a pretty piece. Why don’t you let me have a look?”

I could smell him now. Gin, unwashed wool, the sweet-rot smell of a bad tooth. The calculus was immediate. A fight here, now, was noise. It was attention. It was a variable introduced too early, in the wrong equation. It could spoil everything.

He was close enough that I could hear his breathing. “Cat got your tongue? Or are you just stupid?”

This was the other language. The one they understood. I had shown my teeth in *De Visser* and made them look away. This one required a sharper demonstration.

In one motion, I pivoted. Not away, but into him. I let the momentum carry my arm, the knife a dark blur. I didn’t aim for his body. I aimed for the space he occupied, for his threat. The blade stopped a hair’s breadth from the hollow of his throat. I had stepped inside his guard, my body close to his, the knife hand rock-steady. My other hand was a fist in the greasy wool of his coat.

His eyes were wide, the whites gleaming in the gloom. The gin-sour breath hitched in his chest.

“No,” I said, my voice lower than the wind. “It is not too big for me. And you are in my light.”

I held the pose, letting him feel the certainty in my grip, the absolute lack of tremor. Letting him understand that this was not a bluff, that I was not a *meisje*, not a stray cat. I was a woman with a diver’s knife and nothing left to lose. The gender of the thing meant nothing. The power did. And for this frozen moment, the power was a cold line against his throat.

He swallowed. A thick, wet sound. I saw the decision flicker in his eyes: the bruised pride, the rising anger, and beneath it, the animal fear of the sharp, hard thing pressing into his skin. Fear won. It usually did.

I pushed him back, just enough to break contact. I didn’t step away. I made him step back. One shuffling step, then another. He turned and scuttled into the deeper shadows, a rat returning to its hole.

I sheathed the knife and put it back in my pocket. My heart was a slow, heavy drum. No adrenaline, no fear. Just a cold confirmation. The language worked. It was the only one that ever did.

I looked back at the water. The last of the light was gone. The city behind me was a constellation of yellow windows, a map of a thousand contained lives. Ahead was only the dark and the deep. My father had taught me that in the water, panic was death. You had to accept the pressure, the cold, the lack of light. You had to become a part of it. Then you could move.

Van der Meer’s world was the same. A different kind of pressure, a more subtle cold, a more deceptive darkness. But the principle held. I had to stop fighting the fact of it. I had to accept that I was in it, that it would crush me if it could. And then I had to move.

I left the pier and began the long walk to the Amstel. The streets grew quieter, the respectable glow of the canal belts giving way to the scattered, industrial glow of the developing south. The site was a scar on the city’s edge. A vast, ordered chaos of mud, timber, and ambition. During the day, it swarmed with men and machines. Now, under a moonless sky, it was a tomb for giants. The silhouettes of cranes stood like sentinels. Piles of brick and timber were dark mounds. The main foundation pit, the heart of Van der Meer’s new palace of commerce, was a gash of deeper blackness in the earth.

A high wooden fence surrounded it, but a section had been loosened, a single plank pried back just enough for a slender variable to slip through. Rafael’s work. I paused, listening. The wind moaned through the girders. Somewhere, a loose sheet of tin clattered. No voices. No guards. Van der Meer would not post guards. He would not share this moment. This was his ritual, his private communion with power. He would be alone. He believed himself secure within the gears of his own machine.

I slipped through the gap.

The ground was churned mud, frozen into treacherous ruts. I moved from shadow to shadow, from the hulk of a silent steam shovel to the lee of a mortar mixer. The pit lay ahead. I approached its edge and looked down.

It was a square hole, thirty feet to the bottom. The earth walls were shored up with timber. At the center, the foundation stone had been laid weeks ago—a massive block of granite. But before it, a smaller, simpler stone had been placed. A pedestal. And on that pedestal, resting on a cushion of black velvet even in the mud, was the *Zeevonk*.

It pulsed.

It was not a light, but an anti-light. A slow, rhythmic drawing-in of the darkness around it. A blue so deep it was almost black, a heartbeat of void. It made the night around it seem faint, insubstantial. Looking at it was like looking at a hole in the world, a hole that led to a cold, hungry depth where no light had ever been. The stone from the deep. The heart of the machine.

And standing before it, his back to me, was Van der Meer.

He wore a formal black coat, as if for a board meeting. His hands were clasped behind his back. He was utterly still, a man in prayer. The eerie, draining pulse of the stone washed over him, making him a silhouette cut from the fabric of the night itself.

This was it. The point of failure. The place where the variable had to be introduced.

There was a ladder fixed to the side of the pit, leading down. I put my hand on the cold wood. Then I stopped.

A whisper of sound. Not from the pit. From behind me.

I melted back against the timber shoring, pulling my coat close. Two figures emerged from between piles of brick. Not workmen. Their movements were too fluid, too quiet. They were dressed in dark, close-fitting clothes. They carried no lanterns. They moved like they knew the dark.

They went to the edge of the pit, not far from where I stood, and looked down at their master and his prize. They did not speak. They simply took up positions, one on either side of the ladder, facing outwards. Guards. Not the uniformed kind. The other kind. The kind Rafael had warned me about. The kind that worked in the shadows, that cleaned up messes. Van der Meer was not a fool. He was a man who calculated risk. He would not come alone. He had brought his own gears, his own teeth.

The calculus changed. Drastically.

One man, I might have surprised. One man, with the cold ferocity of nothing left to lose, I might have reached. Two professional killers, watching the only entrance, changed the equation from difficult to impossible. I was not a soldier. I was a woman with a knife and a death wish. They were the embodiment of the machine’s immune system. They would swat me aside before I was halfway down the ladder.

The seed of true resolution, planted in the darkness of this all-is-lost moment, began to stir. It was not a plan. It was a memory. The maid’s clenched hands. The dock rat’s fearful retreat. The language of power was not always direct force. Sometimes it was leverage. Sometimes it was understanding the pressure points of a different machine.

Van der Meer’s machine was powered by greed, by control. But it was populated by people. And people had other pressures. Other loyalties. Other fears.

I looked at the two guards. They were part of his system, but they were not him. They were tools. And tools could be turned, if you found the right weakness, if you applied pressure to the right point.

I closed my eyes, shutting out the pulse of the stone, and thought. Rafael’s words. *The city is a machine, too. More complex than his.* I had been trying to jam Van der Meer’s machine directly. A frontal assault. But Rafael worked within the city’s gears. He used its complexity.

I could not fight these men. But the city could.

I slipped away from the pit’s edge, back into the maze of construction. I moved quickly now, with purpose. I emerged from the site at a different point, circling around to the nearest proper street. It was deserted, lined with darkened workshops. But a few blocks away, I knew there was a *politiebureau*. A small, sleepy outpost for a district that was mostly mud and ambition.

I did not run toward it. I walked. But my walk was the walk of the docks, of *De Visser*. The walk of a woman who was not a victim. I pushed open the door to the station house.

The air inside was warm and stale, smelling of coal smoke, cheap paper, and old sweat. A single, weary officer in a rumpled uniform sat behind a high desk, writing in a ledger by the light of an oil lamp. He looked up, his expression shifting from boredom to mild annoyance at the interruption.

“*Ja?* What is it?”

I did not approach as a supplicant. I stood just inside the door, letting the cold air from outside swirl around me. I met his eyes and held them. I spoke in the flat, uninflected tone of someone reporting a fact, not asking for help.

“There is a theft in progress at the Van der Meer construction site on the Amstel. The new foundation. Men with tools. They are breaking into the site office.”

The officer’s eyebrows lifted. “Van der Meer’s site? And who are you?”

“A night-watchman’s daughter. He is sick. I walk his round.” The lie came easily, dressed in the plain cloth of truth. “I saw them. Three men. They had crowbars.”

I leaned forward slightly, just enough to let the lamplight catch the earnest fear I forced into my eyes. The other language. “The *heer* Van der Meer… he is a strict man. If there is theft and my father is not there… it will be his position. Please. If you come quickly, perhaps you can catch them.”

I invoked the two pressures the city’s machine understood: property and patronage. The threat to a rich man’s property, and the potential downfall of a poor man to a rich man’s wrath. It was a story this officer could process. A woman reporting a crime was suspect. A daughter trying to save her father’s job was sympathetic. A chance to be seen doing his duty for a powerful man was opportunity.

He hesitated for only a second, weighing the chill of the night against the potential benefits. Duty, and a chance to curry favor, won. He heaved himself to his feet, grabbing his hat and a heavy wooden baton from a hook.

“Show me.”

“They were at the east fence, by the office shed,” I said, pointing back the way I came. “I… I dare not go closer. My father would kill me.”

He grunted, a sound of masculine understanding. “Wait here.”

He strode out into the night, his boots ringing on the cobbles. I did not wait. The moment the door swung shut, I was moving again, a shadow retracing my steps, but on a different vector.

By the time the officer’s shouted “*Halt! Politie!*” echoed across the silent site, I was back at the edge of the foundation pit. The scene below had changed.

Van der Meer had turned from the stone. He was looking up, his face a pale mask of fury in the negative light. His two guards were no longer at the ladder. They were gone, lured away by the disturbance at the far end of the site—the sound of their master’s property being threatened, the blundering intrusion of the city’s own clumsy gear.

It was the only window I would get.

I did not use the ladder. I sat on the edge of the pit, turned, and dropped, my feet finding the rough timber shoring, my hands scraping down the cold earth as I half-slid, half-fell the thirty feet to the bottom. I landed in a crouch, the impact jarring my knees, mud soaking instantly through my clothes.

Van der Meer stared. For a second, pure, uncomprehending astonishment wiped the fury from his face. He saw a mud-smeared woman rising from the ground of his sacred pit. I was an impossibility in his calculus.

“You,” he breathed. The word was not fear. It was disgust. The disgust of a master clockmaker finding a slug in his gear train.

I pulled Pieter’s knife from my pocket. The leather sheath fell to the mud. The blade, freed, seemed to drink the faint, stolen light from the stone.

“The variable,” I said.

His astonishment hardened into contempt. He didn’t call for his guards. He didn’t move. He simply stood between me and the pulsing *Zeevonk*, as if his presence alone were a barrier I could not cross.

“Els de Vries,” he said, his voice regaining its smooth, oiled control. “The diver’s daughter. The little rat from the docks. Rafael’s errand girl. I should have had you smothered in your cradle.” He took a step forward, not away from me, but toward me. “Do you think that toy makes you a threat? You are a flaw. A speck of grit. And I am the millstone.”

He was not a physical man. He was soft where my father had been hard, pale where Pieter had been weathered. But his power was not in his body. It was in his certainty. He believed, utterly, in the hierarchy of the world. He was at the top. I was at the bottom. The knife in my hand was a violation of natural law.

“You took my father,” I said, beginning to circle, forcing him to turn, to keep the stone in my sight. “You took Pieter. You are taking the soul of this city, piece by piece, to feed that thing.”

“I am *giving* this city a soul!” he snapped, the control cracking for an instant, revealing the fanatic beneath. “A new heart! One that beats with order, with power, with purpose! Not the weak, sentimental flutter of the past. Your father was a relic. Pieter was a fool who thought he could bargain with the deep. They were consumed by the old world. I am building the new one. And you…” He smiled, a thin, cruel stretch of the lips. “You are just a sacrifice it requires. The final piece. The unexpected variable that perfects the equation. The deep demands a price, girl. It always has. Why do you think the sea takes men? It is a transaction.”

He lunged then. Not at me, but to the side, toward the pedestal. His hand closed around the *Zeevonk*.

The effect was instantaneous.

The slow, sucking pulse became a violent surge. The blue-black void-light erupted, not outwards, but inwards, into him. It raced up his arm, veins of anti-light branching under his skin. His back arched. A sound tore from his throat that was not human—a grating, resonant shriek, like stone grinding on stone. The air turned brittle and cold. The mud at our feet began to frost over.

He was not controlling the stone. He was merging with it. The machine and its maker becoming one.

His eyes opened. They were no longer his eyes. They were pools of the same hungry void, the same deep blue-black. He turned them on me, and I felt it—a pulling, a draining. Not of light, but of will. Of heat. Of life. It was the feeling of the deep pressure, magnified a thousand times, focused into a gaze.

“See,” the thing that was Van der Meer said, its voice a chorus of whispers from a cold abyss. “See the heart of the new world.”

My limbs felt heavy. The knife in my hand seemed like a absurd twig. The cold was inside me, in my bones, in my blood. This was the true machine. Not gears of iron, but gears of stolen essence, of consumed lives. And I was next in line.

But the seed, planted in the darkest moment, broke through.

*A single, determined variable, introduced at the precise point of failure…*

The point of failure was not Van der Meer. It was the transaction. The price. The deep demanded a sacrifice. He had offered my father, Pieter, the city itself. But the deep, like the city, was a machine. And it could be jammed.

I did not fight the cold. I did not try to strike at him. I accepted the pressure, the crushing, soul-sucking void. I stopped being a woman trying to kill a man. I became the variable.

I threw the knife.

Not at Van der Meer. At the stone.

Pieter’s knife. The diver’s tool. The sentimental man’s luck. It was not steel aimed at a heart. It was a symbol aimed at a transaction.

The blade tumbled, a flash of dull metal in the negation of light. It struck the *Zeevonk* not with a clang, but with a sound like a bell cracking under ice.

And it stuck.

The pulsing stopped. The inward surge of void-light froze. The chorus of whispers became a single, sharp, silent scream of wrongness.

Van der Meer stared at the knife hilt protruding from the heart of his power. The void-light in his eyes flickered, confused. The transaction was corrupted. The sacrifice was tainted. A tool, a memory, a piece of the sentimental, human world he despised, was lodged in the heart of his perfect machine.

“No…” he whispered, his own voice returning, ragged with pain and disbelief. “No, it… it is not… the equation…”

He staggered, clutching his chest as if the knife were in him. The connection was breaking. The stone began to vibrate, a high, painful whine that shivered in the teeth. Cracks, lines of real, ordinary black, spiderwebbed across its blue-black surface.

The machine was jamming.

He turned his desperate, human eyes to me. The hatred in them was pure, undiluted, the last fuel in a dying engine. “You ruin… everything…”

From above, shouts. The clatter of boots on the ladder. His guards, returning. The police officer, confused and shouting. The city’s gears, intruding.

Van der Meer made a last, desperate grab for the stone, for the knife, to pull it free, to reset the equation.

I didn’t stop him. I just watched as his fingers closed around the hilt of Pieter’s knife.

The *Zeevonk* shattered.

It did not explode. It imploded. There was a sound like a vast intake of breath, and then a silent, concussive wave of force that had no light, no heat, only a profound, nullifying *absence*. It blew outwards from the pedestal.

It hit Van der Meer first. He simply… unraveled. His form smeared, like ink in water, and was sucked into the collapsing point where the stone had been. There was no scream. Just a final, vanishing sigh.

The wave hit me.

It was not pain. It was the total negation of feeling. Of thought. Of self. For an eternity that lasted less than a second, I did not exist. I was the variable consumed by the failed equation.

Then the world rushed back in. Sound: shouts, screams, the groan of timber. Sensation: the frozen mud against my cheek, the taste of dirt and iron in my mouth. I was lying on my side, ten feet from where I had stood. The pedestal was empty. Of the stone, of the knife, of Van der Meer, there was no sign. Only a shallow, perfectly smooth depression in the earth, as if something had been neatly, surgically, erased.

Boots splashed through mud. Rough hands grabbed my shoulders, rolled me over. I looked up into the face of one of Van der Meer’s guards. His professional calm was gone. His face was a rictus of terror and fury. Behind him, the other guard held the bewildered police officer at bay, a knife to his throat.

The guard who held me shook me, his fingers digging into my collarbone. “What did you do? *What did you do?*”

I looked past him, up at the rim of the pit. Other figures were gathering, silhouetted against the night sky—workmen roused by the noise, more police. The city’s machine was waking up to the chaos in one of its newest gears.

I looked back at the guard. I smiled. It was a show of teeth, bloody and cold.

“I jammed the machine,” I whispered.

His fist drew back. I saw it coming. I didn’t try to move. The darkness after the wave was still in me, a comforting blanket. Let it end here. Let the final, crushing gear do its work.

But the blow never landed.

A new voice, sharp with authority, cut through the din. “Release her. Now.”

The guard froze. He looked up.

Standing at the top of the pit, flanked by four men in dark coats who were not police, was Rafael. He held no weapon. He needed none. His presence was a different kind of pressure. He looked down, his face impassive, taking in the scene: the empty depression, the missing stone, the missing magnate, the mud-smeared woman in the grip of a thug.

“This is a city matter now,” Rafael said, his voice carrying the weight of the hidden gears. “Release her to me.”

The guard’s eyes darted from Rafael to his partner, to the growing crowd. The calculus changed again. Their master was gone. Their purpose was void. The city’s official machine, and its hidden counterpart, were converging. To fight was to be ground to paste between them.

He let me go, shoving me back into the mud. He and his partner melted into the shadows of the pit, disappearing into the construction maze like the rats they were. The police officer stumbled free, clutching his throat, babbling about thieves and ghosts.

Rafael’s men descended the ladder. They did not help me up. They formed a cordon around me. Rafael climbed down last, picking his way fastidiously through the mud. He stopped before the smooth, empty depression. He looked at it for a long moment. Then he looked at me.

“The stone?” he asked, quietly.

“Gone.”

“Van der Meer?”

“Gone with it.”

He nodded slowly. The equation had been solved. Not as he’d planned. The variable had not been eliminated; it had corrupted the entire formula. “And the knife?”

“Gone too.”

A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. “Pieter would have appreciated the irony.” He stepped closer, his voice dropping so only I could hear. “You understand, this changes nothing. The machine—the city’s machine—must still turn. There will be an inquiry. A story. A wealthy man disappears at his construction site. A strange woman found at the scene. The gears will demand a narrative.”

I pushed myself to my knees. The cold was settling into my bones, the deep, permanent cold of the void. “What narrative?”

He looked at me, and in his eyes I saw the final, cold truth of his world. “That depends on you, Els. You can be the tragic victim. The madwoman. The thief. Or…” He paused. “You can be a variable that is absorbed. A useful piece in a new configuration. The woman who witnessed a tragedy, who helped bring clarity. The choice is yours. But you must choose now. Before the larger gears engage.”

He was offering me a place within the machine. Not as a victim, not as grit to be ground away, but as a cog. A small, silent one, perhaps. But a part of the grind. It was the only survival his world permitted.

Above us, the official voices grew louder. Lanterns bobbed. The city was here, in all its clumsy, hungry majesty.

I looked at the empty space where the heart of a new world had almost beaten. I looked at my muddy, empty hands. I had swum toward the cold, blue pulse, and I had found only a deeper dark. I had jammed the machine. But the city’s machine, the old, complex, heartless one, was still here. It would always be here.

I met Rafael’s gaze. I had no teeth left to show. Only a bottomless cold, and a single, final question.

“What,” I asked, my voice raw with the chill of the deep, “do you need me to say?”

# Chapter 24

## **Chapter 24**

The rain was a soft, persistent murmur on the cobbles, a gentle afterthought to the storm that had broken the world. It soaked into the shoulders of my new coat—thick, grey wool, government-issue—with a patient indifference. It did not needle. It simply was. I walked, my footsteps a measured, official sound against the wet stone, the echo contained by the high, gabled facades of the Herengracht.

The warmth inside the *Binnenhof* committee room was a controlled, dry heat, smelling of polished wood, ink, and the faint, waxy scent of power. The low murmur of men in dark suits hit a lull as I entered. Not many women came in here alone, not at this hour, not dressed like this: a clean, pressed cog in the state’s machine. I met the glances of the committee members, held them for the exact, prescribed beat—respectful, but not challenging—until they returned to their papers. A show of compliance was the only currency they understood in here.

“Mevrouw Visser.” The chairman, a man with a face like a folded ledger, nodded from the high bench. He did not smile. He gestured to the solitary chair placed in the pool of light from the green-shaded lamp. Testimony expected now, in precise words and in a specific order. Always order, in this case.

I took the seat, my fingers resting on the cool, varnished wood of the table before me. They were clean. The nails were short, unbroken. There was no grit under them.

“For the final time, for the official record,” the chairman intoned, his voice dust-dry. “Describe the events of the night of the twenty-third, at the Van der Meer construction site.”

I drew a breath. The air here had no fryer grease, no brine. It had no taste at all.

“I was conducting a follow-up inquiry,” I began, the words smooth and familiar from repetition, “into the disappearance of my client, Meneer Pieter van der Linden, as previously detailed in my earlier statements. My contract, as entered into evidence, permitted such activity. I had reason to believe Meneer van der Meer might have information.”

The story unspooled from me, a clean, efficient thread. A concerned brother. A corrupt developer. A deal gone wrong. A tragic confrontation. I was a witness. A professional doing a job, caught in a dangerous situation between two ruthless men. I had seen van der Meer, agitated, holding a strange artifact—a geological oddity, perhaps, from his dredging work. In the struggle with van der Meer’s man, Rafael—a known fixer with a history of violence—the artifact was lost to the waters. Van der Meer, in his panic, had fallen. A terrible accident. A tragedy.

I had tried to help. I had called the authorities.

The words were a kind of masonry, building a plausible, sturdy wall behind which the truth could lie buried, a cold, blue pulse extinguished in the deep silt. I was the bricklayer. My payment was my continued existence within the walled city.

“And your relationship with the individual known as Rafael?” another committee member asked, his eyes sharp behind his spectacles.

“Professional. Antagonistic. He was an agent of Meneer van der Meer. He attempted to impede my investigation. He is currently assisting with inquiries elsewhere.” My voice was flat. Neutral. Rafael was in another room, in another building, likely giving a different but complementary version of this calibrated truth. We were gears now, meshing silently to turn the larger mechanism. He had his place. I had mine. The machine demanded synergy, not conflict.

The chairman made a note. “And the artifact? This… ‘stone’?”

“As I said. Lost. It seemed to be a point of obsession for Meneer van der Meer. Of no material value, I should think. Just a rock.”

They nodded. A rock was a good thing to lose. It asked no questions, demanded no audits.

The inquiry lasted another hour. They picked at the edges of my narrative, not to tear it, but to seam it more neatly into the official tapestry. The story was needed. The city’s gears—the press, the courts, the civic record—demanded a narrative. The wealthy, overreaching developer, killed by his own ambition. The brave, if unfortunate, brother lost earlier to the man’s ruthlessness. A tidy circle. A closed case.

I was the useful variable that had been absorbed. The woman who had witnessed, who had helped bring clarity. Not a victim. Not a madwoman. A functionary of resolution.

When they dismissed me, it was with a curt thanks. My coat was waiting on the stand. I put it on, feeling the weight of the good wool, the broad cut that hid the shape beneath. I walked out into the central courtyard of the Binnenhof. The rain had softened to a mist, blurring the sharp Gothic lines of the Hall of Knights into something mournful and distant.

A figure detached itself from the shadow of a pillar. Rafael. He fell into step beside me, our footsteps matching on the wet flagstones. He wore a dark, well-tailored suit. He looked like a senior clerk. A trusted one.

“It is done,” he said, not looking at me.

“It is done.”

“Your statement was satisfactory.”

“As was yours, I assume.”

A faint, almost imperceptible nod. The irony was not lost on either of us. We had tried to destroy each other. Now our survival was mutually assured by the lie we told in unison. The ultimate transaction.

“They have offered you a position,” he said as we passed under the archway, out toward the street. “The new municipal liaison office. Investigating certain… delicate matters. Matters where a woman’s perspective might be useful for public perception.”

I had known the offer was coming. It had been implied in the chairman’s final, assessing look. The machine always found a use for a tool that had proven durable.

“And you?” I asked.

“A similar role. Different department. We will not need to see each other often.”

That was a relief, written in the cold air between us. We stopped at the canal’s edge. The water was grey, opaque, holding its secrets close.

“He would have hated this,” Rafael said quietly. “Van der Meer. All that power, that vision… reduced to a clerical error. A footnote in a committee report.”

“He wanted a new world,” I said. “The old one just digested him.”

Rafael turned to look at me then, and I saw the man who had pointed a knife at my heart, who had bargained with monsters. But the fervor was gone. The knife was gone. In his eyes was only the flat, efficient sheen of a man who balances ledgers that deal in lives. “There is no new world, Els. There is only the machine. You can be outside it, and be crushed. Or you can be inside it, and turn. Those are the only coordinates.”

He touched the brim of his hat—a polite, meaningless gesture—and walked away, his form dissolving into the mist and the bureaucrats streaming out for their midday meal.

I stood alone. I had my life. I had a job that would pay in coin, not in kind. I had a story that would hold. I had been pulled from the void and slotted neatly into the great, grinding clockwork of the city. I was safe. I was warm. I was clean.

The cold I felt then had nothing to do with the weather. It was the cold of the deep, the abyssal chill I had chosen to swim away from. I had jammed the machine of a mad god, only to become a lubricated part of the older, subtler, more patient one. I had shown my teeth so many times, only to learn that in this place, the real power lay in having no teeth at all. In having a smooth, blank face that asked no questions that mattered, that told only the stories it was fed.

I began to walk, not toward the new municipal offices, but away from them, my feet carrying me without conscious direction. The grand canals gave way to narrower waterways, the fine houses to workshops and warehouses. The smell of the city changed—less wax and polish, more damp brick, rust, and the distant, familiar tang of the sea.

I found myself on a familiar bridge. The rain had stopped. Below, the water of the *Oudezijds* was the color of tarnished lead. I looked down at my reflection in the murky surface: a woman in a grey coat, her face pale and indistinct. A respectable ghost.

My hands, buried in the deep pockets, closed into fists. They were empty. They were always empty now. But in my mind, I felt the ghost-weight of the stone—not the god-thing, but the first one, the river-smoothed piece of granite Pieter had given me a lifetime ago. A paperweight. A reminder of a different kind of depth. I had thrown it into the sea to save a man who was already dead. A futile, human gesture.

From the pocket of the fine coat, my fingers retrieved not the stone, but a single, worn guilden. My last coin from the old life. I turned it over. The metal was warm from my skin.

I did not throw it in. I held it tight. A show of teeth was not currency here. But perhaps a single, stubborn coin of one’s own could be. Not to buy anything. Just to prove you still had something that wasn’t issued to you.

I walked off the bridge. The streets grew tighter, darker, smelling of life lived raw and close. I heard the clatter of a cart, the shout of a fishmonger closing up, the wail of a child from an open window above. The city’s true sound, beneath the murmur of committees.

And then I saw the sign, swinging gently in the damp breeze: *De Visser*. The paint was more faded than I remembered. One of the windows was cracked, patched with tape.

I stopped. The warmth from within would be a physical blow, thick with the smell of stale beer and brine and hard work. The conversation would be a low, guttural murmur. Heads would turn if I walked in. Not many women came in here alone, not at this hour, not looking like I did: a respectable ghost haunting the wrong neighborhood.

Jan would be behind the zinc counter. He would not smile. He would see the coat, the clean hands, the empty, official look in my eyes. He might nod. He might not. He would push a chipped tumbler of *jenever* across the wood. Payment expected later.

In coin, or in kind.

I stood there for a long time, on the threshold of the rain-darkened street and the yellow light pooling from the tavern window. The choice was not the one Rafael had given me. That choice was already made. The machine had me.

This was a different choice. A smaller one. A choice of rooms. Of which kind of warmth to pretend could thaw the deep cold inside.

I could walk in. I could take the glass. I could let them see the ghost, let them whisper. I could pay in the coin I had, and see what, if anything, I got in kind.

Or I could turn, and walk back toward the wide, clean canals, to the office with the dry heat and the taste of nothing, to the life that had been given to me, where I would be a useful, silent cog, turning in the dark, telling the stories I was fed until I forgot I had a voice of my own.

The mist beaded on the wool of my government-issue coat. I looked at my reflection in the tavern window—a blurred, grey shape against the glow of human noise.

Slowly, I unbuttoned the coat. I took it off. I folded it over my arm, hiding the institutional grey. Beneath, I wore a simple, dark dress. It was my own.

I pushed open the door of *De Visser*.

The warmth was a physical blow. The smell hit me—stale beer, brine, the tang of worked bodies—like a forgotten language. The low murmur stumbled, then died. Heads turned. Eyes, hard and curious, appraised the woman who walked in alone. They saw the dress, the face that was no longer a girl’s, the eyes that had seen the bottom of things.

I met the glances. I held them. I did not look down. I did not smile.

I walked to the zinc counter. Jan, older, greyer, but still built like a barrel, looked up from a glass he was polishing. His eyes took me in. They flickered over the folded coat on my arm. They saw the woman beneath it. He gave no sign of recognition. No sign of welcome.

He placed the polished glass down. He reached for the bottle of *jenever*. He poured two fingers into a chipped tumbler and pushed it across the wood.

I laid the single, worn guilden on the counter between us. It was not enough. It was never enough.

He looked at the coin. He looked at me. His gaze was flat, unreadable as the canal water outside.

Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he pushed the coin back toward me. He gave the faintest shake of his head. His eyes held mine, and in their depths was an older, simpler understanding. Payment was expected later.

In coin, or in kind.

I took the glass. My fingers closed around the chill of it. I did not drink. I turned, leaning my back against the solid wood of the bar, facing the room. I looked at the men hunched over their drinks, at the shadows pooled in the corners, at the world that was real and rough and unforgiving.

I had come back to the beginning. But I was not the same. The stray cat was gone. In its place was something harder to define. A woman who knew the price of the machine, and the cost of staying out of it. A woman with a story she would never tell, and a cold inside her that no warmth could touch.

But she was here. In her own dress. With a coin in her pocket that was her own. And a glass in her hand, paid for on a promise.

The murmur of conversation started up again, lower now, weaving around me. I was part of the scenery again. A fixture. I took a sip. The *jenever* burned its familiar, cleansing path down my throat.

The door opened again, letting in a slice of damp, grey light. A man entered, shaking water from his hat. He was young, his face drawn with a worry too sharp for his years. He scanned the room, his eyes skipping over the regulars, searching. They landed on me. They hesitated. A woman, alone at the bar.

He approached. Not with the swagger of the regulars, but with the tentative step of someone seeking something specific in the wrong place.

“Mevrouw?” he said, his voice barely above the rumble of the room. “They said… they said I might find someone here. Someone who asks questions.”

I turned my head slowly. I looked at him. I said nothing. I just waited, the glass cool in my hand.

He swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “It’s my sister. She’s gone. The police, they say she’s just run off. But she wouldn’t. Not like this.” He reached into his inner pocket, pulled out a folded, much-handled piece of paper. A cheap lithograph. A girl’s face, smiling stiffly. “They won’t listen. They have their story.”

I looked from the paper to his eyes. I saw the desperation there. The refusal to be digested by the easy narrative. The grit in the machine.

The cold inside me shifted. It did not thaw. It focused. It became a point, a needle of ice.

I looked past him, to Jan behind the bar. He was watching, his expression unchanged. I raised my glass a fraction of an inch. An acknowledgment. A promise.

I turned back to the young man. I took the lithograph from his trembling fingers. The paper was cheap. The girl’s smile was a lie. But the question in her brother’s eyes was the truest thing I had seen all day.

“Sit down,” I said, my voice rough with the *jenever* and the long silence of official rooms. I nodded to the stool beside me. “Tell me.”

He sat. The machine turned in its distant, well-oiled chambers. But here, in the warm, smelling dark of *De Visser*, a different kind of work was beginning. A smaller grind. A human one.

I took another sip, and listened.
