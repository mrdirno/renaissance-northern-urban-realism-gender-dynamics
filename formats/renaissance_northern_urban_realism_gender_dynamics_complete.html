<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1-1"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h2>
<p>Cloth, not coin, was the currency of this marriage. Margriet’s
fingers, chapped from lye, traced the weave of her husband’s new
doublet—fine Flemish wool, dyed madder-red with her savings. From the
street below, the guildsmen’s laughter was a blunt instrument. She
counted each thread in the selvedge, her arithmetic of silence.</p>
<p>The warmth inside was a physical blow, thick with the smell of stale
beer, brine, and the underlying tang of bodies that had worked all day.
Conversation, a low, guttural murmur in the local dialect, hit a lull as
heads turned. Not many women came in here alone, not at this hour, not
looking like I did: a stray cat dragged through a puddle. I met the
glances, held them for a beat too long until they slid away. A show of
teeth, however subtle, was the only currency they understood in
here.</p>
<p>“Els.” Jan, the owner, a man built like a barrel with a beard to
match, nodded from behind the zinc counter. He didn’t smile. He just
pushed a chipped tumbler of <em>jenever</em> across the wood, the clear
liquid catching the weak, yellow light of the overhead lamp. Payment
expected later, in coin or in kind. Usually coin, in my case.
Usually.</p>
<p>I took the glass, my fingers stiff and red, and found my spot in the
corner, my back to the wall. The gin burned a clean, medicinal path to
my stomach, a small hearth lit inside. From here, I could see the whole
room: the old men playing a silent, grim game of cards; the dockworkers
with forearms like cured hams, their laughter too loud; the two men in
better coats, city clerks maybe, hunched over a whispered conversation.
And him. Pieter.</p>
<p>He was at his usual table, near the stove. A draftsman for the
shipyards, he called himself. An artist. His hands were stained with
ink, not tar, long-fingered and restless. He was sketching on a napkin,
head down, a lock of dark hair falling over his brow. He hadn’t seen me
come in. Good. I liked to watch him unobserved, to see the slight frown
of concentration, the way he’d chew his lower lip. He was too fine for
this place, too fine for me, a fact he seemed blissfully, stupidly
unaware of.</p>
<p>I was halfway through the second gin, bought this time with the last
of my coins, when the door banged open again. The wind rushed in,
carrying a spray of rain and three men. They weren’t regulars. You could
tell by the cut of their clothes—not rich, but trying to be—and by the
way they stood, scanning the room like they were buying cattle.
Mercantile types from the South, maybe. Speculators. Leeches.</p>
<p>They took a table, ordered beer, and their voices rose above the
room’s murmur. Talk of tariffs, of grain shipments from the Baltic, of
profit margins. One of them, a florid man with a gold ring on his pinky,
held forth.</p>
<p>“—a simple matter of logistics,” he boomed. “You get the wives to
manage the ledger books. Keeps them from meddling in affairs of
substance. A busy mind is a chaste mind, eh?”</p>
<p>His companions chuckled. The card players glanced over, faces blank.
Pieter’s head came up. He looked at the men, then his eyes found me in
the shadow. A flicker of something—apology? complicity?—passed between
us before he looked down again, his pencil moving faster.</p>
<p>The florid man’s gaze swept the room and landed on me. A woman alone,
nursing a drink. A curiosity. His eyes, small and bright like a pig’s,
assessed. I stared back, letting my face go empty, a window with the
shutters closed.</p>
<p>“See?” he said, not lowering his voice. “Even here. Independence is a
draft that chills the hearth.”</p>
<p>Something hot and sharp flared behind my ribs. It wasn’t the gin. It
was the tone, the casual ownership in it. I saw Pieter’s shoulders
tense. Don’t, I thought at him. Don’t be a fool.</p>
<p>But Pieter was a fool. He stood up. He wasn’t tall, but he was lean,
and standing he had a certain taut energy. The room quieted.</p>
<p>“The lady,” Pieter said, his voice clear but with a reediness to it,
“is not a draft. She is a citizen. And this is her city as much as
yours.”</p>
<p>A beat of silence. Then the florid man laughed, a wet, hearty sound.
“Is she? And what are you, her herald? Her little rooster?”</p>
<p>Pieter flushed. “I am saying you will keep a civil tongue.”</p>
<p>“Or what? You’ll sketch me to death?”</p>
<p>One of the man’s companions, younger, with a mean twist to his mouth,
stood. “The boy wants to play the knight. Let’s give him a lesson in the
lists.”</p>
<p>This was escalating in the worst, most predictable way. Pieter had
the courage of principle but not the fists for it. The younger man was
already rounding the table. Jan the barman sighed, hefting a thick oak
club from beneath the counter. He wouldn’t intervene until the blood or
the broken furniture threatened his profit.</p>
<p>I stood up. My chair legs scraped loud on the tile floor. All eyes
swung to me.</p>
<p>I didn’t look at Pieter or the florid man. I walked to the younger
one, who had paused, confused by this new variable. I stopped very close
to him. I could smell the wool of his coat, the onion on his breath. I
looked up into his face. My voice, when I spoke, was low, for him alone,
but in the silent room it carried like a stone dropped in a well.</p>
<p>“You touch him,” I said, “and I will follow you home. I will learn
where you sleep. And one night, you will wake with my knife between your
ribs. Not tonight. Maybe not next week. But you will wake to it. Do you
understand the transaction?”</p>
<p>His bravado drained. He saw it in my face: I was not bluffing. I was
stating a logistical fact. A busy mind is a chaste mind. A dead man is a
simple ledger entry.</p>
<p>He blinked, took a half-step back. The florid man spluttered. “See! A
harpy! A viper!”</p>
<p>I turned my head slowly toward him. “You are a guest in our city.
Finish your beer. Pay your tab. And go back to wherever you keep your
wife and your ledger book. The draft from the door will be at your
back.”</p>
<p>For a long moment, only the hiss of the stove and the drum of rain on
the window filled the space. Then the florid man threw a few coins on
the table, stood, and jerked his head at his companions. They left, the
door closing softly behind them, swallowing their muttered outrage.</p>
<p>The room remained still. Then Jan gave a single, gruff laugh and put
his club away. The card game resumed. The murmur of conversation started
up, louder now, peppered with glances my way.</p>
<p>Pieter was still standing by his table, pale, his eyes wide on me. I
walked back to my corner, picked up my glass, and drained the last of
the gin. The heat was gone. It was just a bitter wash now.</p>
<p>He came over. “Els… thank you. That was… incredibly brave.”</p>
<p>“It was incredibly stupid,” I said, not looking at him. “They’ll be
back, or men like them. And they won’t be alone. You painted a target on
your own back, and then you stood in front of it.”</p>
<p>“He insulted you.”</p>
<p>“He insulted an idea of me. It costs me nothing.” I finally looked at
him. His face was open, earnest, bruised by the world’s carelessness. It
made me tired. “Principles are a luxury, Pieter. Like clean paper. Not
all of us can afford them.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that,” he said, but his voice lacked conviction.</p>
<p>“Believe what you like. Just do it more quietly next time.” I stood,
my body aching with a sudden fatigue. The adrenaline was gone, leaving
the cold damp and the hollow of my stomach.</p>
<p>“Let me walk you home,” he said quickly.</p>
<p>“I know the way.”</p>
<p>“Please. It’s pouring.”</p>
<p>I looked at his offered coat, his hopeful, ink-stained hand. The
kindness was a different kind of debt. But the rain was a ceaseless
hammer on the roof, and the walk to my canal-side room was long, and the
dark would be absolute in the narrower alleys. Even vipers get cold.</p>
<p>“Walk behind me,” I said. “And don’t talk.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The city at night was a different beast. The rain-slicked cobbles
reflected the occasional guttering candle from behind thick, leaded
glass. The canals were black ink, swallowing the rain, the houseboats on
them dark hulks. Our footsteps were the only sound, mine a firm tap, his
a softer shuffle a few paces back. I led him through a maze of streets,
past the great bulk of the New Church, past shuttered guildhalls with
their stone coats of arms weeping water.</p>
<p>I turned onto the narrow street where I lived, the houses leaning so
close overhead they nearly kissed, blocking out the sky. The stench of
the canal here was ripe, a living thing of sewage and damp rot. I
stopped at a door, paint peeling like a sunburn, and fished the heavy
iron key from my pocket.</p>
<p>Pieter caught up, his breath making plumes in the air. He looked at
the door, the sagging step, the dark windows above. His artist’s eyes
were taking it in, measuring the poverty. I saw the pity start to form
in them and killed it with a look.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen me home. Now go.”</p>
<p>“Els… what you did back there. The way you spoke. It was like you’d
done it before.”</p>
<p>The rain dripped from the gutter above, a steady <em>plink-plink</em>
into a puddle. A light went on in a window across the canal, a brief,
golden rectangle that illuminated the falling silver threads before
shutting off again.</p>
<p>“Everyone in this city has done everything before, Pieter,” I said,
my voice flat. “That’s what a city is. Layers of the same things, over
and over, like silt in this canal. Goodnight.”</p>
<p>I turned the key and pushed inside, leaving him standing in the rain
and the dark. I didn’t bolt the door. I leaned against it, the rough
wood against my back, and listened. I heard his footsteps, hesitant at
first, then moving away, fading into the city’s wet murmur.</p>
<p>Only then did I breathe out. The hallway was black, colder than the
street. I groped my way up the narrow, twisting stairs, my hand on the
sticky banister. My room was on the top floor, under the eaves. A
garret. A cage with a view of other cages.</p>
<p>I didn’t light the candle. I went to the small, warped window and
looked out. The canal below was a strip of black velvet. Down the
street, I saw a figure pause under a lone lamp. Pieter. He looked back
once, at my window, a shadow looking at a shadow, then he turned the
corner and was gone.</p>
<p>I peeled off my wet coat, my dress clinging to my skin. The room held
the chill of the day. In the dark, I was just a body, tired and cold.
The woman in the tavern who spoke of knives and consequences was a
performance, a suit of armor worn for the occasion. It was a good suit.
It fit well. But it was heavy.</p>
<p>I lay on the thin mattress, listening to the rats skitter in the
walls, a sound as much a part of the city as the bells. The ghost of the
gin was gone. The ghost of Pieter’s pity remained. And underneath it,
colder and deeper, was the knowledge that the florid man from the South
had been right about one thing. I was a draft. And drafts, eventually,
must be shut out.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-2-1"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></h2>
<p>The morning came hard and grey, light seeping through the grime on my
window like a stain. My head was a lump of clay, my mouth wool. The
memory of the night before assembled itself in sharp, unwelcome pieces:
the rain, the men, the threat, Pieter’s face. Foolishness, all of
it.</p>
<p>Work was the only antidote. I washed with water from the pitcher, the
cold biting into my skin, and put on my other dress, the slightly less
worn one. It was a dull blue, the colour of a faded bruise. I twisted my
hair, the colour of dirty straw, into a tight knot at my nape and pinned
it with bone needles that had once been my mother’s. My face in the
sliver of mirror was all angles and shadows, eyes a pale grey that gave
nothing back. A serviceable face. It could be forgettable or formidable,
depending on the light.</p>
<p>Downstairs, my landlady, Mevrouw de Wit, was waiting in the narrow
hallway. She was a slab of a woman, built for blocking doorways, her
arms permanently crossed over a vast, apron-covered bosom.</p>
<p>“The rent,” she said, by way of greeting. Her voice was the sound of
gravel shifting.</p>
<p>“It’s Tuesday,” I said. “Rent’s due Friday.”</p>
<p>“A reminder. In advance. Given recent… instability.” Her small eyes,
like currants in dough, flicked over me. News travelled in the sediment
of this city, sinking from taverns to landladies with alarming
speed.</p>
<p>“The rent will be there Friday,” I said, my tone leaving no room for
discussion. I moved past her, catching the smell of cabbage and caraway
that clung to her.</p>
<p>“See that it is,” she called after me. “Or your ‘citizenship’ can be
exercised elsewhere.”</p>
<p>The dig was precise. She’d heard about Pieter’s words. I didn’t turn
back.</p>
<p>Outside, the city was shaking itself awake. The rain had stopped,
leaving the world scrubbed raw and gleaming. Barges were moving on the
canals, loaded with barrels and bales. Shopkeepers were rolling out
awnings. The air was a cocktail of baking bread, horse dung, and the
ever-present damp. I walked with purpose, my clogs <em>clacking</em> on
the stones, joining the stream of other bodies heading to workshops,
markets, warehouses. I was a particle in the city’s daily flow.</p>
<p>My destination was the <em>Vermeylen</em> workshop, a three-story
brick building squeezed between a tannery and a cooperage. The smell was
a potent triumvirate: acrid chemicals, sawdust, and the sweet-rot scent
of hides. I entered through the side door, into the clattering, buzzing
heart of the place.</p>
<p>A dozen looms stood in rows, their rhythmic <em>thump-clack,
thump-clack</em> a deafening symphony. Girls and women, from twelve to
sixty, sat before them, their hands flying, their eyes fixed on the
intricate patterns emerging in the threads. The air was thick with lint
that caught in the throat and sunlight that cut through high windows,
illuminating the dancing dust motes.</p>
<p>“You’re late, Visser.”</p>
<p>Meneer Vermeylen stood by his office door, a ledger in his hands. He
was a thin, desiccated man who looked as if he’d been woven from the
same tight, grey thread he sold. His eyes missed nothing.</p>
<p>“The streets were crowded, meneer.”</p>
<p>“The streets are always crowded. Your loom was not.” He made a note
in his ledger. A deduction, no doubt. “The Haarlem order. The complex
floral. It must be finished by week’s end. No errors.”</p>
<p>I nodded, hanging my coat on a peg. My loom was at the back, near the
window that overlooked the tannery’s yard. It was the least desirable
spot for the smell, but the light was good. I took my seat, my body
settling into the familiar motions before my mind had fully arrived. My
hands checked the warp threads, tight as harp strings, then I fed the
weft shuttle through the shed. <em>Thump</em> with the beater,
<em>clack</em> of the pedals changing the shed. Again. And again.</p>
<p>This was my skill. My hands understood the language of thread and
tension. They could take a design—a curling acanthus, a detailed coat of
arms, a scene of biblical submission—and translate it into being, knot
by infinitesimal knot. It was work that required absolute attention and
allowed for absolutely no thought. My mind could go blank, a blessed
emptiness filled only with the mechanical poetry of the loom.</p>
<p>Around me, the other weavers worked in near-silence, broken only by
the looms and the occasional muttered curse. We were not a talkative
group. Conversation wasted energy and invited mistakes. But I felt their
eyes on me, sidelong glances. Word had travelled here, too. The girl who
threatened men with knives in taverns. I kept my gaze on my pattern, my
face a mask of concentration.</p>
<p>At the midday break, we gathered in the small, dank yard behind the
workshop, clutching our bread and cheese. I sat apart on a low wall.
Katrijn, a woman my age with a permanent squint from close work, sidled
over. She had a sharp, ferrety face and a hunger for gossip that was
almost professional.</p>
<p>“Heard you gave some Southern windbags a fright at <em>De Visser</em>
last night,” she said, her voice low.</p>
<p>“I paid for my drink. They paid for theirs. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I heard. I heard you promised to gut one like a
herring.” She took a bite of cheese, watching me. “They say the
draftsman stood up for you first. Pieter, is it? The pretty one with the
sad eyes.”</p>
<p>I said nothing, tearing my bread into small, precise pieces.</p>
<p>“Careful, Els,” she said, leaning closer. Her breath smelled of
onions. “That kind of attention… it’s two-sided. Men like that, they
want gratitude. In a specific shape.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>
<p>“You do.” She nudged me with a bony elbow. “Just a friendly warning.
A woman’s reputation is a cheaper cloth than what we weave here. It
tears easy and can’t be mended.”</p>
<p>She wandered off, leaving the warning hanging in the tannery-tinged
air. I looked down at my hands, the fingers strong and nimble, the nails
short and clean. They were my livelihood. They were also the hands that
had gestured with an imaginary knife. Which were the real ones?</p>
<p>The afternoon was a long, aching stretch of repetition. The floral
pattern grew under my hands, a burst of crimson and gold against the
deep blue field. It was for a wealthy merchant’s wife in Haarlem,
something to hang on her wall to prove she could afford beauty she had
no part in making. My back began to scream from hunching. My eyes burned
from the focus. But I was ahead of schedule. The work was flawless.</p>
<p>As the light began to fade and the looms gradually fell silent,
Meneer Vermeylen made his rounds with his ledger. He stopped at my loom,
peering at the work with a critical eye. He leaned close, smelling of
ink and stale sweat. His finger, dry as a twig, traced a line of the
pattern without touching it.</p>
<p>“Acceptable,” he pronounced. “You will stay late. The Van Dyck
commission needs the border finished. The client is impatient.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a request. Staying late meant a few extra stuivers, but it
also meant walking home in the full dark. I thought of Mevrouw de Wit’s
reminder, the empty coin purse in my room. I thought of the long, black
canals.</p>
<p>“Yes, meneer.”</p>
<p>The others filed out, their voices a sudden, relieved chatter that
faded as they left the workshop. Soon, it was just the settling sounds
of the building and the frantic scratching of a rat in the wall. I lit
the oil lamp at my loom, its small, smoky flame pushing back the shadows
only a little. I moved to the other loom, where the Van Dyck tapestry—a
hunting scene with dogs and falcons—was stretched. The border was a
repetitive geometric knot. Mindless, tedious work. My body protested,
every muscle stiff.</p>
<p>I had been working for perhaps an hour when the side door opened. I
assumed it was Vermeylen, checking on my progress. But the footsteps
were too heavy, too confident.</p>
<p>I turned.</p>
<p>It was the florid man from the tavern. The one with the gold ring. He
stood just inside the door, his bulk blocking it. He was alone. He
smiled, but it didn’t reach his piggy eyes.</p>
<p>“We meet again,” he said. His voice was too loud in the empty
space.</p>
<p>My heart gave one hard, sickening thud against my ribs, then settled
into a cold, rapid rhythm. I stayed seated, my hands still on the
shuttle. “The workshop is closed.”</p>
<p>“I saw the light. I inquired. The master was most helpful. A small
donation to his understanding.” He took a step forward, looking around
at the silent looms, the ghosts of labour. “A woman of many talents, it
seems. Weaver. Harpy. Fortune teller of knives.” He stopped a few feet
from me. “You cost me face last night. In front of my associates. In
front of that… boy.”</p>
<p>“You cost yourself that,” I said, my voice steady. “I merely
presented the bill.”</p>
<p>“A woman does not present bills to a man.” He said it quietly, a
simple statement of cosmic law. “A woman incurs debts. And you, my dear,
are now in arrears.”</p>
<p>He reached out, not for me, but for the nearly finished Van Dyck
tapestry. His ringed finger brushed the intricate weave of a falcon’s
wing. “Such fine work. It would be a shame if something were to happen
to it. A spill of oil from this lamp, perhaps. An accidental tear. Your
master would be… displeased. The financial repercussions for you would
be severe, no?”</p>
<p>The threat was clear, elegant in its cruelty. My livelihood, held
hostage. I looked from his smug face to the vulnerable fabric. Hours,
days of my life were in that thread. My rent. My food. My fragile
independence.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” The question was ash in my mouth.</p>
<p>“An apology will suffice. A proper one. On your knees would be
traditional, but we can start with words.” He crossed his arms, waiting.
The conqueror.</p>
<p>The <em>thump-clack</em> of the looms was a memory in the air. The
smell of the tannery was suddenly overwhelming. I saw my hands, pale in
the lamplight, resting on the brown wool of the weft. I saw the sharp,
steel tip of the shuttle in my right hand. It was not a knife. But it
was pointed. And it was real.</p>
<p>I stood up slowly. My knees did not buckle. I did not look at the
tapestry. I looked only at him. I took a step forward, closing the
distance he had established. I saw a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes.
He had expected tears, submission, the crumbling of my tavern
bravado.</p>
<p>I held up the shuttle, turning it so the lamplight glinted on its
metal tip. I spoke softly, as I had to his companion, but now the room
was so quiet the words seemed etched into the silence.</p>
<p>“You will turn around,” I said. “You will walk out of this door. You
will forget this street, this workshop, and my face. If you do not, I
will not wait for night. I will not follow you home. I will show you,
right here, that a woman can indeed present a bill. And I will collect
it with this.” I gestured slightly with the shuttle. “It will not be
neat. It will not be quick. And when they find you bleeding out among
the looms, I will tell them a thief came in, a desperate man, and I
defended my master’s property. Who will they believe? A stranger from
the South? Or a weaver, with her tool in her hand?”</p>
<p>His florid face had gone pale, then mottled with rage and fear. He
looked at the shuttle, at my eyes, at the absolute conviction there. He
believed me. Because it was no longer a performance. It was the bedrock
truth of my survival, laid bare.</p>
<p>He took a step back. Then another. His breath hissed between his
teeth. “You are mad,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“I am from here,” I corrected.</p>
<p>He turned and fumbled for the door handle, his dignity in tatters. He
yanked it open and vanished into the deepening twilight.</p>
<p>I stood there, the shuttle still raised. The adrenaline was a torrent
this time, shaking my limbs. I listened until his footsteps faded away.
Then I slowly lowered my hand. I walked to the door, closed it, and slid
the heavy iron bolt across. The <em>thunk</em> was final.</p>
<p>I returned to my loom. The Van Dyck tapestry was unharmed. My hands
were trembling. I clasped them together, hard, until the trembling
stopped. Then I picked up the shuttle again. I sat down. I fed the weft
through the shed.</p>
<p><em>Thump. Clack.</em></p>
<p>The rhythm was mine. The night was mine. The debt, for now, was paid.
But the ledger, I knew, was still open.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-3-1"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></h2>
<p>The bolt on the workshop door was for keeping rats and the casual
thief out, not for keeping the world at bay. I knew he wouldn’t return
that night, but the space felt contaminated. I worked until the border
was done, my movements mechanical, my mind a locked room. When I finally
blew out the lamp, the darkness was absolute and heavy. I unbolted the
door and stepped into the alley.</p>
<p>The city night was its usual self—a tapestry of shadows, distant
laughter from a tavern, the slosh of water against a canal wall. But
every sound was now a potential footfall, every deeper shadow a possible
shape. I walked quickly, my clogs unnaturally loud, my hand in my pocket
clutching not a knife (I had none) but the cold, sharp metal of my loom
shuttle. It was a poor weapon, but it was a fact in my hand.</p>
<p>I reached my street without incident. The house was dark. Mevrouw de
Wit’s room on the ground floor was silent. I crept up the stairs, each
creak of the wood a cannon shot in the stillness. Inside my room, I
didn’t light the candle. I went to the window and looked down. The
street was empty. Just the silver sheen of moisture on the cobbles, the
black ribbon of the canal.</p>
<p>Sleep was a fractured thing. I dreamt of taut threads snapping, of
patterns unravelling into meaningless tangles, of a florid face laughing
silently behind a pane of thick, wet glass.</p>
<hr />
<p>Morning was a grey repetition. My body ached as if I’d been beaten.
At the workshop, the rhythms resumed. <em>Thump-clack. Thump-clack.</em>
Katrijn shot me curious looks but said nothing. Meneer Vermeylen
inspected the finished border on the Van Dyck piece with a grunt that
might have been approval. He counted out my extra stuivers into my palm,
his fingers dry and brief against my skin. The transaction was clean.
Nothing about last night showed on his ledger. I wondered what
“donation” the Southerner had made, and what story he’d been told.</p>
<p>I was threading a new warp, a mindless but delicate task, when the
side door opened again. My head jerked up, my hands freezing. But it was
only a boy, maybe thirteen, grubby and breathless. He had a note, which
he handed to Vermeylen. The master read it, his lips pursing, then his
gaze swept the room and landed on me.</p>
<p>“Visser. You are to go to the <em>Stadhuis</em>. The Civic Guard.
Room of the <em>Schout</em>. Now.”</p>
<p>A cold different from the morning chill settled in my bones. The
<em>Schout</em> was the city’s chief lawman. The note. It could only be
one thing. The florid man had chosen a different currency: official
complaint.</p>
<p>The other weavers had stopped. The looms fell silent one by one. In
the sudden quiet, Katrijn’s whisper was clear as a bell. “Told you.
Attention is two-sided.”</p>
<p>“Finish your warp when you return,” Vermeylen said, as if sending a
weaver to the authorities was a common errand. “Your time will be
deducted.”</p>
<p>I took off my apron, my fingers clumsy. I felt every eye on me as I
walked to the door. The walk to the <em>Stadhuis</em>, the city’s grand
town hall with its ornate gables and aura of power, was a blur. My mind
raced. Would they believe him? A man of commerce, with associates? My
word against his. A weaver with a reputation for sharp words and sharper
threats. I had no family to speak for me, no husband, no guild
brotherhood. I was a single, frayed thread.</p>
<p>I was shown into an antechamber that smelled of waxed wood and
anxiety. After an eternity, a clerk ushered me into the
<em>Schout</em>’s room. It was panelled in dark oak, the windows high
and narrow. Behind a large desk sat <em>Schout</em> Hendrik van Ruijven,
a man with a carefully trimmed beard and the tired eyes of someone who
has heard every lie the city can concoct. And standing by the window,
looking out with his hands clasped behind his back, was Pieter.</p>
<p>My confusion was momentary, then it hardened into a new, sharper
dread. Pieter. Of course. The noble fool. He’d heard, or guessed, and
come to “speak on my behalf.” To make things infinitely worse with his
principled, poetic innocence.</p>
<p>“Els Visser?” Van Ruijven’s voice was dry, without inflection.</p>
<p>“Yes, <em>meneer de Schout</em>.”</p>
<p>“This concerns an incident two nights past at the tavern <em>De
Visser</em>. An altercation with a merchant, one Maarten van Houten,
currently lodging at <em>The Golden Lion</em>.”</p>
<p>So he had a name. Maarten van Houten. I stored it away.</p>
<p>“There was a disagreement, <em>meneer</em>. It was settled. He and
his men left.”</p>
<p>“He claims you threatened his life. With a knife.”</p>
<p>“I have no knife, <em>meneer</em>. I am a weaver.” I held out my
hands, showing the calluses from the shuttle, the stained fingertips.
“My tools are of wood and thread.”</p>
<p>Van Ruijven’s eyes flicked to my hands, then back to my face. He was
a reader of people, not of ledgers. “He claims you threatened to follow
him and murder him in his sleep. A specific threat.”</p>
<p>“A woman’s words, spoken in fear to make loud men leave her alone.
They were effective. They left.”</p>
<p>Pieter turned from the window. His face was strained.
“<em>Schout</em>, if I may. I was there. The men were drunk and
insulting. They threatened me first. Els… Mejuffrouw Visser… she
intervened to prevent violence. Her words were a shield, not a
sword.”</p>
<p>Van Ruijven held up a hand, silencing him. He looked at Pieter with
mild impatience, then back at me. “Van Houten also claims you threatened
him again last night. At your place of work. With a… weaving tool.”</p>
<p>So he had complained about that, too. The coward. He hadn’t mentioned
his own threat to destroy property, to ruin me. Of course not.</p>
<p>“He came to the workshop after hours, <em>meneer</em>. He was angry
about the tavern. He made threats against my employment. I told him to
leave. I may have picked up my shuttle. I was afraid.” I let a tremor
enter my voice. It wasn’t hard. “A woman alone, in an empty building,
with an angry man from out of town… what would you have done?”</p>
<p>I was painting a picture now, with different threads. The vulnerable
worker. The menacing outsider. It was a pattern the city fathers
understood better than one of a woman holding her ground.</p>
<p>Van Ruijven leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. He
looked from my carefully constructed fear to Pieter’s earnest concern,
then to a paper on his desk. “Van Houten is demanding satisfaction. A
formal apology, or a fine for disturbing the peace and threatening
behaviour.”</p>
<p>“I have no money for a fine,” I said, which was true.</p>
<p>“An apology, then. Public. At his lodgings.”</p>
<p>That would be the end of me. Word would spread. I’d be marked as a
troublemaker who’d been brought to heel. Vermeylen would let me go. No
other workshop would take me. Mevrouw de Wit would evict me. An apology
was a social death sentence.</p>
<p>“That is not just,” Pieter burst out. “She has done nothing wrong! He
is using the law to bully and shame her!”</p>
<p>“The law,” Van Ruijven said coolly, “is a loom. It weaves together
complaint, witness, and evidence into a cloth of judgment. The pattern
here is… messy.” He tapped the paper. “You, Heer van Houten, have a
complaint, but your witnesses are your business associates. You,
Mejuffrouw Visser, have a witness—” he nodded at Pieter, “—but he is a
friend, and his account is of the first incident only. The second is
your word against his.” He sighed, the sound of a man weary of the
city’s petty knots. “A trial would be costly and time-consuming for all.
And bad for trade.”</p>
<p>He let the silence hang. I saw the calculation in his eyes. Van
Houten was a merchant, a node in the city’s commercial network. I was a
single weaver, a replaceable cog. The math was brutal and simple.</p>
<p>“Therefore,” he continued, “I will make a ruling. Mejuffrouw Visser,
you will pay a nominal fine of one guilder for intemperate language.
Heer van Houten, you will be advised that harassing citizens at their
place of work after hours is not the behaviour our city welcomes in its
commercial guests. Consider this a mutual lesson in civility.”</p>
<p>One guilder. It was a week’s rent. It was food. It was everything.
But it was not a public apology. It was a financial bleeding, not a
social execution. I saw the compromise, the oily political practicality
of it. He was splitting the difference, preserving the peace, and
teaching no one anything except where the real power lay.</p>
<p>“I will see the fine is paid, <em>Schout</em>,” Pieter said
immediately, stepping forward.</p>
<p>“No.” The word left my mouth sharper than I intended. Both men looked
at me. Pieter, hurt and confused. Van Ruijven, intrigued. “Thank you,
Heer van Ruijven. I will pay the fine. When is it due?”</p>
<p>“By week’s end.” He made a note. “You may go.”</p>
<p>I turned and left the room, my back straight. I heard Pieter’s
hurried footsteps behind me in the corridor.</p>
<p>“Els, wait! Please. Let me help. It’s my fault. If I hadn’t spoken up
in the tavern—”</p>
<p>I stopped and faced him in the cold, stone corridor. “Yes. It is your
fault. Your noble, stupid fault. You lit the fuse and then seemed
shocked when the powder keg exploded. Now I am a guilder poorer, and
that man’s pride is merely dented, not dismantled. He will tell his
friends he had me fined. The story will grow. Do you understand? You
didn’t protect me. You made me a character in a story where I get
fined.”</p>
<p>His face crumpled. “I only wanted to do what was right.”</p>
<p>“Right is a colour that doesn’t run in the wash, Pieter. It’s a
luxury dye. I can’t afford it.” I started walking again, out into the
weak midday sun of the square.</p>
<p>He caught up, walking beside me, his voice low and urgent. “Then let
me pay the fine. It’s the least I can do.”</p>
<p>“And put myself in your debt? Another kind of ledger. No.” I kept
walking, my eyes on the uneven cobbles. “Stay away from me, Pieter. Your
‘right’ is too expensive.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you mean that,” he said, but his voice lacked its
usual conviction.</p>
<p>I didn’t answer. I walked all the way back to the workshop, feeling
his gaze on my back until I turned a corner. When I slipped back into my
seat at my loom, the others were at their midday break. The room was
empty. I picked up my shuttle. My hands were steady.</p>
<p>*Thump. Cl</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-4-1"><strong>Chapter 4</strong></h2>
<p>The guildhall’s fine was a stone in my gut, a constant, grinding
weight. A guilder. A week’s careful living, a month of small comforts, a
buffer against the next horizontal rain. It wasn’t the money, not
entirely. It was the ledger of it, my name inscribed in Van Ruijven’s
neat, damning script. A public accounting of my insubordination.
Pieter’s noble guilt was a fog I’d left behind in the square, but the
chill of the judgement lingered.</p>
<p>The workshop felt different when I returned. The empty looms stood
like silent witnesses. My own loom, with its half-finished Haarlemmer,
was a cage of familiar dimensions. I picked up the shuttle. My hands
were steady, but the rhythm was off. <em>Thump. Clack.</em> The beat was
martial now, a counting of coins with every throw. The wool, once a
medium for subtle skill, was just thread, measured in stuivers per ell.
I worked until my shoulders burned and the light bled from the high
windows. The others trickled back, their chatter a soft, indecipherable
wool around me. They glanced, then glanced away. News travelled in this
city not on feet, but on the damp air itself, seeping into every crack.
I was the woman who’d been fined. The character in the story.</p>
<p>When the master released us, the dusk was a blue bruise over the
rooftops. I didn’t go home. Home was a rented closet smelling of damp
plaster and my own solitary cooking. Instead, I turned my feet towards
the <em>Vismarkt</em>. The fishmongers were long gone, their stalls
hosed down to a slick, scaleshimmering cleanliness that couldn’t mask
the day’s ripe history. The canals here were wider, black mirrors for
the gabled houses that leaned in, whispering to one another across the
water. This was a different anatomy of the city. Less bone and muscle,
more vein and open palm. Wealth flowed here, quiet and deep.</p>
<p>I was navigating the unfamiliar rules. The rule was: a woman alone
was a question. The rule was: a question required an answer. I kept my
chin down, my gaze ahead, a needle threading through the gathering dark.
I had no business here, among the grand houses with their leaded glass
windows already glowing yellow. I was a loose thread on the wrong side
of the cloth.</p>
<p>A bridge took me over a canal, its arch a stone sigh. On the other
side, the houses were narrower, pressed together for support. A sign
creaked: a painted lobster, its claws bound. <em>‘t Gebonden
Kreeftje</em>. The Bound Lobster. Light spilled from its windows,
buttery and weak. It was not <em>De Visser</em>. It would not have
Pieter in it, nursing a wounded conscience. I pushed the door.</p>
<p>The warmth here was thinner, laced with smoke and a sweet, malty
smell. A few men looked up from their clay pipes and pewter tankards.
Their assessment was slower, less instinctual than the fishermen’s.
These were shopkeepers, clerks, men whose hands were stained with ink,
not brine. My entrance was noted, filed, and largely dismissed. I was
not a novelty here, just an anomaly. I found a small table in a corner
where the shadows pooled, my back to the wall.</p>
<p>A serving girl, not much older than me but with a tired sag to her
shoulders, brought a pot of beer without my asking. She placed it with a
soft thud, a gesture that spoke of long hours and small expectations.
“Tuppence.”</p>
<p>I laid the coins on the table. She swept them away. No conversation.
It was a transaction of beautiful purity. I drank. The beer was thin,
slightly sour, but it cut the dust from my throat. I was listening, not
to any one conversation, but to the room’s hum. The dialect here was
softer, less guttural, laced with French words and talk of shipments, of
tariffs, of the damned English and their wool embargo. This was the
language of the ledger, not the sea. I understood it better. My father
had spoken this language, hunched over his accounts until the candle
guttered.</p>
<p>Two men entered, shaking damp from their cloaks. They took a table
near the fire. One was broad, with a face like a friendly ham. The other
was whip-thin, his eyes doing a constant, quiet inventory of the room.
They fell into talk, their voices a low, earnest rumble. I caught
fragments. “…not a question of capacity, but of access. The East India
men have the monopoly sewn up tighter than a sail in a gale. A private
consortium needs backers who aren’t afraid of a little…”</p>
<p>The thin man’s eyes flickered to me, then away. I held my tankard,
looking into its brown depths. A woman alone, drinking cheap beer. A
blank page. He leaned forward, his voice dropping further. I heard
“…Schout’s office… new levies…” and the other man grunted, a sound of
disgust. “Van Ruijven’s a weathervane. He points where the guild money
blows.”</p>
<p>My spine straightened a fraction. I took a slow sip.</p>
<p>The ham-faced man noticed my attention. Not my ears, but the simple
fact of it. He offered a genial, non-committal nod, the kind given to
stray cats who aren’t causing trouble. I gave a slight, neutral dip of
my chin in return. No teeth. No invitation. An acknowledgement of shared
space. He returned to his conversation.</p>
<p>They were potential allies only in the broadest sense—men who chafed
under the same structures, who saw the gears of power and resented their
place as grist. They would not help me. But they were a source. A font
of the kind of information that was currency in places like this. I
learned nothing concrete, but I learned the landscape. The names they
cursed, the gates they found closed.</p>
<p>When they rose to leave, the thin man’s hand brushed against my
table, jostling my tankard. A small spill spread like a dark star on the
wood. “Pardon, <em>mejuffrouw</em>,” he said, his voice dry as old
paper.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” I said, my voice low.</p>
<p>He paused, his inventory-taking eyes resting on my face for a full
second. He saw the fine wool of my dress, mended but well-made. He saw
the hands that were not a lady’s hands. A calculation ran behind his
gaze, and came up with no satisfactory sum. He tipped his hat, a minute
gesture, and followed his companion out.</p>
<p>The door had barely shut behind them when it opened again. A
different quality of cold entered. Three younger men, their cloaks fine
but worn at the edges, their faces flushed with prior drink and a kind
of aggressive bonhomie. They brought the outside’s harshness in with
them. Their eyes swept the room, landed on me, and stuck.</p>
<p>I felt it like a change in pressure. The quiet clerks at the other
tables seemed to shrink into their own smoke. The serving girl vanished
into the back.</p>
<p>One of them, the leader with a wispy attempt at a beard and eyes set
too close together, sauntered over. He planted a hand on my table,
leaning down. His breath smelled of gin and onions. “All alone in the
gloom, <em>meisie</em>? That’s a poor state of affairs.”</p>
<p>I looked at his hand, then up at his face. I said nothing. A show of
teeth was one thing. This required a different silence.</p>
<p>“Cat got your tongue? Or just too good for the company?” His friends
chuckled, a hollow sound. “This is a respectable place. A woman drinking
alone… people might get the wrong idea.” He let the implication hang,
oily and familiar.</p>
<p>This was the clear antagonist. Not a man in power, but a foot soldier
of nuisance. His power was borrowed, temporary, fueled by the pack at
his back and the assumed vulnerability of my solitude. He was Van
Ruijven’s judgement, distilled to its crudest form.</p>
<p>“I have the right idea,” I said, my voice flat. “You are interrupting
my beer.”</p>
<p>His close-set eyes widened, then narrowed. A public rebuke. A tiny
defiance. It was the kindling he needed. “You’ve a sharp tongue. Maybe
you need a lesson in keeping it behind your teeth.”</p>
<p>He reached for my tankard, as if to take it away. A petty dominance.
My hand shot out, not to stop him, but to grip the handle firmly. Our
fingers did not touch. We were both holding the scarred pewter, a
ridiculous stalemate.</p>
<p>“Let go,” he hissed.</p>
<p>“You let go,” I said, quieter.</p>
<p>His friends shifted, their amusement turning to a readiness for
something uglier. The room was a held breath.</p>
<p>Then, a new voice, calm and firm, cut the tension like a blade. “Is
there a problem, Heer Dekker?”</p>
<p>A man stood from a shadowed booth I hadn’t noticed. He was older,
perhaps fifty, with a neatly trimmed grey beard and the sturdy, compact
build of a once-sailor. His clothes were dark, unadorned, but of
excellent cloth. He held a pipe, unlit, in one hand.</p>
<p>The young man—Dekker—flinched, his bravado leaking away. “Master de
Witt. No, no problem. Just… making conversation.”</p>
<p>“It sounded very one-sided,” de Witt said. He didn’t raise his voice.
He didn’t need to. He walked over, his movements economical. He looked
at Dekker’s hand on my tankard, then at Dekker’s face. “The lady is
engaged. With her beer. You are engaged with the door. I suggest you
both continue with your engagements.”</p>
<p>It was not a request. Dekker’s hand sprang back as if scalded. He
muttered something, shot me a look of pure venom, and jerked his head at
his companions. They left in a clatter of boots and wounded pride.</p>
<p>The silence they left behind was profound. De Witt turned his gaze to
me. It was assessing, but not invasive. He saw the same things the thin
man had seen, but his calculation seemed different. “My apologies,
<em>mejuffrouw</em>. The city breeds more rats than cats some
evenings.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said. My heart was a trapped bird against my ribs. I
forced my hand to release the tankard. It came away steady.</p>
<p>“May I?” He gestured to the empty chair opposite. I nodded. He sat,
not leaning forward in false camaraderie, but upright, his hands resting
on the table. “Johannes de Witt. I own a small provisioning concern. And
you are caught in the wrong part of town after dark.”</p>
<p>“Els,” I said. It was half the truth. “A spinner. And I find the
right parts of town are usually locked.”</p>
<p>A faint smile touched his lips. “A spinner with a taste for politics?
You listened to Van Hoorn and his partner earlier with the ear of a
clerk.”</p>
<p>So he had been watching. I felt a prickle of alarm, but also a thread
of opportunity. “I listen to everyone. It’s cheaper than buying
newsheets.”</p>
<p>“And often more accurate.” He took out a small pouch of tobacco and
began to fill his pipe with deliberate, careful motions. “Van Ruijven’s
new fine for public disturbances is a topic of interest. It seems to
fall more heavily on some than others.”</p>
<p>The stone in my gut twisted. He knew. Of course he knew. The story
was growing, just as I’d told Pieter it would. “It is an efficient tax,”
I said, choosing my words like stepping stones. “It taxes the appearance
of disorder, rather than the disorder itself.”</p>
<p>He struck a flint, lit his pipe, and drew on it. The sweet smoke
formed a brief, fragrant curtain between us. “You have a mind for
systems, Mejuffrouw Els. A valuable thing. A dangerous thing.” He
studied me through the smoke. “You work for Master van Aelst? The
loom-works by the tannery?”</p>
<p>I nodded, once.</p>
<p>“A good master. Fair. But a guild man to his bones. The guilds…” He
paused, choosing his words. “They are like the dikes. Necessary. They
hold back the chaos of the sea. But they also determine the shape of the
land, forever. They decide what can grow inside the walls.”</p>
<p>“And outside the walls?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That is the question, isn’t it?” He smiled again, this time with
more warmth. “There are other ways. Smaller channels. Private contracts.
Work that doesn’t require a guild stamp, but requires skill, discretion,
and a strong stomach for risk.”</p>
<p>He was offering help. Or the shape of it. Not charity, but a
transaction. Crucial information. A potential path around the wall I’d
just been fined for bumping into.</p>
<p>“My stomach is strong,” I said. “But my purse is currently light. A
guilder light.”</p>
<p>“I heard.” He let that sit. “A man’s pride is an expensive thing to
injure. Especially a small man in a large hat.” He took another draw on
his pipe. “I may have work for hands like yours. Not at the loom. Finer
work. Mending, repairing. The sort of work done in quiet rooms, for
clients who value the repair more than the pedigree of the repairer. The
pay is better. The questions are fewer.”</p>
<p>It was a lifeline. It was also a door into a world I didn’t know,
with rules I couldn’t yet see. “What would it require?”</p>
<p>“A sample of your skill. On material I provide. A meeting, here, in
three nights’ time. If the work is satisfactory, we agree on terms.” His
tone was that of a merchant, plain and clear. It was a tone I trusted
more than Pieter’s fervour or Dekker’s bluster.</p>
<p>“I will be here,” I said.</p>
<p>“Good.” He rose, knocking his pipe gently against the table edge.
“Three nights. Ask for the back room.” He placed two stuivers on the
table. “For the spilled beer.” Then he was gone, melting into the gloom
of the tavern and out the door, leaving behind the scent of good tobacco
and possibility.</p>
<p>I sat for a long time, finishing my beer. The small challenges of the
evening—navigating the strange streets, parsing the new language, facing
down Dekker, parsing de Witt’s offer—lay behind me. I had learned new
skills: how to listen in a new key, how to wear my solitude like armour,
how to recognise an offer that was not a leash. The guilder was still a
stone in my gut, but now it had a counterweight.</p>
<p>When I left <em>‘t Gebonden Kreeftje</em>, the night was fully
formed, cold and clear. The stars were sharp chips of ice above the
crooked rooftops. I walked quickly, my senses sharpened. In a narrow
alley, a shortcut I knew, I heard the scuff of a boot behind me.</p>
<p>I didn’t turn. I sped up, my pulse quickening. The footsteps matched
my pace. Closer. I gripped the key in my pocket, its metal teeth
protruding between my knuckles. A poor weapon, but a weapon.</p>
<p>Just before the alley opened onto my street, a figure stepped from a
doorway, blocking the way ahead. The silhouette was lean, hat pulled
low. I stopped, turning slightly to face the follower. Trapped.</p>
<p>The figure ahead spoke, Dekker’s voice stripped of its false
bonhomie, thin with spite. “Thought you were clever, didn’t you? Getting
old de Witt to fight your battles.”</p>
<p>I said nothing, measuring the distance to the alley mouth behind me,
to the walls on either side.</p>
<p>“A guilder’s fine is nothing,” Dekker said, taking a step forward. “A
lesson in respect, that’s what you need. A private lesson.”</p>
<p>His friend behind me chuckled. The calculus was simple, brutal. I
tightened my grip on the key.</p>
<p>Then, from a high window above us, a shutter slammed open with a
crack like a gunshot. A woman’s voice, ragged with sleep and fury,
shrieked down into the alley. “<em>Godverdomme!</em> Silence! I’ll empty
a chamber pot on the lot of you, I swear on my mother’s grave!”</p>
<p>A head, wrapped in a linen cap, thrust out into the night. Dekker and
his friend froze, caught in the sudden, ridiculous spotlight of a
neighbour’s rage. It was a farcical interruption, utterly mundane, and
it shattered their predatory tension.</p>
<p>“Piss off, you drunken sots!” the woman yelled, and she did indeed
lean out with a sloshing earthenware vessel.</p>
<p>Dekker cursed, ducking instinctively. He shot me a final, furious
look. “This isn’t over.”</p>
<p>But it was, for tonight. He and his friend melted back into the
darkness, their retreat as swift and shameful as rats from a
lantern.</p>
<p>I looked up at the window. The woman was still there, a solid shadow
against the light behind her. “Thank you,” I called up, my voice
rough.</p>
<p>“Get inside, you fool girl,” she grumbled, but without real heat. The
shutter banged shut.</p>
<p>I stood alone in the sudden quiet, the adrenaline making my knees
weak. I had faced the challenge, navigated the offer, identified the
enemy, and survived the ambush. Not with a show of teeth, but with
silence, with calculation, and with the unwitting aid of a stranger’s
annoyance. I had learned. I had adapted.</p>
<p>I let myself into my tiny room, bolted the door, and leaned against
it. In the absolute dark, I finally smiled. It was not a pleasant smile.
It was the smile of a creature learning the shape of its new cage, and
finding, in one corner, a loose bar.</p>
<p>De Witt’s offer was a loose bar. The guilder was a lock. Pieter’s
debt was a chain of a different make. And Dekker’s spite was a reminder
that the city’s teeth were everywhere, not just in the guildhalls.</p>
<p>I lit a single tallow candle. The flame guttered, then held. From my
small chest, I took out a piece of fabric, a remnant of fine English
broadcloth, too small for anything. And I began, with a needle and
thread so fine they seemed made of thought, to mend an invisible tear
along its selvedge. It was work for my own eyes, a test for my own
hands. The stitch I used was one my mother taught me, a spiral repair
that distributed the strain. It was slow. It was perfect.</p>
<p>When I finished, the candle was half gone. I held the cloth to the
light. The mend was there, but you had to know where to look. You had to
look very, very closely.</p>
<p>I blew out the candle. In the perfect dark, the plan began to form.
Not a grand design, but the first tight, careful stitch in a pattern I
could not yet see. Three nights. A sample. A back room.</p>
<p>And somewhere out there in the sleeping city, a man with a wispy
beard nursed a grudge, and a kind-hearted painter nursed a guilt, and a
<em>schout</em> in a large hat slept the sleep of the judicious. They
were all threads. I was the shuttle.</p>
<p>The hook was set. Not by de Witt, not by the fine, but by my own
decision to pick up the needle. To mend something, even if it was just a
scrap, on my own terms. The next move was mine. And I would make it in a
back room, with a sample of my skill, under the assessing gaze of a man
who saw systems, not souls.</p>
<p>The dark felt less like an ending, and more like a held breath.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-5-1"><strong>Chapter 5</strong></h2>
<p>The morning of the sample arrived not with a bang, but with a seep. A
slow, grey infiltration of light through the high, grimy window of my
room. It carried the damp, mineral smell of the canals and the distant,
rhythmic thump of pile-drivers building something new on ground that was
older than sin. I lay on my narrow cot, listening to the city wake. The
scrape of a barge against stone. A shouted price for herring. The
clatter of wooden clogs on cobbles. A symphony of getting on with
it.</p>
<p>I had been getting on with it for three days. Three days of planning
that felt less like strategy and more like the careful laying of a snare
in a forest you could not see. My allies were not soldiers; they were a
collection of frayed nerves and quiet desperation, bound by a thread I
had spun from my own need.</p>
<p>I dressed with a deliberate, almost ritual slowness. My good
dress—the one not stained with fryer grease or the memory of Dekker’s
leering—was a sober grey wool, high-necked, its only vanity the fineness
of its stitching at the cuffs and collar. My own work. My hair I plaited
and coiled tight against my skull, a helmet of brown. I studied my face
in the sliver of polished tin I used as a mirror. Pale. Shadows like
bruises under the eyes. A mouth set in a line that refused to promise
anything. I looked competent. I looked severe. I looked like a woman who
could be a tool, and nothing more. It was the face I needed to wear.</p>
<p>The first beat of the day was a knock, not on my door, but on the one
below. A pattern: two quick, one slow. Pieter.</p>
<p>I found him in the narrow alley behind the lodging house, a
silhouette against the bright slash of the canal at its end. He was
jittery, turning a worn leather cap over and over in his hands. The debt
sat on him like a physical weight, bowing his already slight
shoulders.</p>
<p>“He’s been asking,” Pieter said without preamble, his voice low.
“Dekker. Came by the yard yesterday. Wanted to know if I’d seen you.
Said a woman with your… talents… shouldn’t be wasting them on mending
nets.”</p>
<p>The word ‘talents’ was a greasy thing in his mouth. I felt the old,
cold anger rise, but I banked it. Fuel, not fire. “What did you tell
him?”</p>
<p>“That I hadn’t. Which is true.” He looked at me, his eyes pleading
for something—forgiveness, or maybe just a sign that this risk was worth
it. “This sample today. If de Witt is impressed… the advance. It’s
real?”</p>
<p>“It’s a possibility. Not a promise.” Honesty was a cruelty, but a
necessary one. False hope was a thread that snapped. “Your part comes
after. Getting the piece out. Can your cousin’s boy be relied upon?”</p>
<p>Pieter nodded, too quickly. “He’s a good lad. Quiet. Sees things.” He
swallowed. “He’s afraid of the <em>schout</em>.”</p>
<p>“Everyone with sense is afraid of the <em>schout</em>,” I said. “It’s
why he’ll keep his head down and his mouth shut. Fear is a better
guarantee than loyalty.”</p>
<p>He flinched at that, as if I’d commented on the weather of his own
heart. I hadn’t meant it as a barb, but it landed as one. The dynamics
here were a fragile glass. Pieter, the man, was beholden to me, the
woman, for a chance to save his skin. It inverted the natural order of
his world, and the strain of it made him both pliant and volatile. A
dangerous combination.</p>
<p>“Meet me at the churchyard of St. Nicolaas at noon,” I instructed.
“Not before. Watch for Dekker’s men. They’ll be loafing about, looking
for trouble to report.”</p>
<p>He nodded again, cramming the cap onto his head. As he turned to go,
he paused. “He said something else, Dekker did. Said a woman alone makes
her own weather, but even the hardest rain finds the gutter
eventually.”</p>
<p>I held his gaze until his eyes skittered away. “Tell Mijnheer
Dekker,” I said, my voice perfectly flat, “that gutters have a way of
backing up in a storm.”</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The second beat was Gerrit. I found him not at the tannery—the stink
would have clung to us both—but at a small, quiet <em>koffiehuis</em>
frequented by clerks and minor functionaries. He sat in a corner, a
large, still rock in a stream of muted chatter and the clink of
porcelain. Before him sat a single, untouched cup of coffee. He looked
like a man awaiting a verdict.</p>
<p>I slid onto the bench opposite. He didn’t startle, just lifted his
heavy-lidded gaze to mine. The kindness in his face was buried deeper
now, under layers of worry.</p>
<p>“You look like you haven’t slept,” I said.</p>
<p>“I haven’t.” His voice was a gravelly whisper. “I keep seeing it. The
warehouse. The nightwatch. The… consequences.” He finally picked up the
cup, his thick, paint-stained fingers looking absurdly delicate on the
handle. “This is madness. A woman, a tanner, and a guilt-ridden fool
walking into the Silk Guild’s storeroom.”</p>
<p>“We’re not walking in. We’re being invited into a back room. There’s
a difference.”</p>
<p>“Is there?” He took a sip, made a face. “The invitation is for you.
For a sample. Pieter and I are… what? Shadows? Your conscience?”</p>
<p>“You’re the distraction,” I said bluntly. “And the muscle, if it
comes to it. And you’re the man who knows the value of what we’re
looking at, so you can tell me what to take.”</p>
<p>He shook his head, a slow, ponderous movement. “This guilt… it was
for a moment of cowardice. This feels like premeditated sin.”</p>
<p>“This is survival, Gerrit. Yours as much as mine. You think de Witt’s
‘system’ has a place for a painter who questions the provenance of his
commissions? You’re a thread he hasn’t yet pulled. He will.”</p>
<p>He knew I was right. The fear in his eyes was twin-born: fear of the
act, and fear of the man who had made it necessary. The gender of it was
subtle, but there. He, the man, was meant to be protector, provider, the
one who took risks. Yet here he was, being led into risk by a woman, his
role reduced to that of a pack animal and a pair of eyes. It scraped
against his nature. I needed that scrape. I needed his discomfort to be
sharp enough to keep him alert.</p>
<p>“The plan is sound,” I said, laying it out on the table between us
like a hand of cards. “De Witt is a man of routines. His head clerk
takes a half-hour for midday prayers at exactly one. The under-clerk is
young, vain, and more interested in the new maid from the kitchen than
the ledger on his desk. The sample room has a northern light. It’s where
they’ll take me. You and Pieter will be in the adjacent anteroom,
waiting ‘on my behalf.’ You’ll complain of the chill. Pieter will need
to use the necessary. The corridors are a maze. A minute is all it
takes. A single, pre-cut bolt of the Venetian crimson. Not the most
expensive, but the most easily missed from a stacked shelf. You’ve seen
the inventory. You know the one.”</p>
<p>He listened, his face a mask. When I finished, he said, “And if the
under-clerk doesn’t fancy the maid that day? If the head clerk has a
crisis of faith and stays at his desk? If someone sees him?”</p>
<p>“Then we leave. We take the sample, we thank Mijnheer de Witt for his
time, and we leave. The hook remains. We try again, another way.” I
leaned forward slightly. “But today, the weather is right. The threads
are aligned. I can feel it.”</p>
<p>He studied me, really studied me, as he might a difficult subject for
a portrait. “You are very calm for a woman about to attempt theft from
the most powerful guild in the city.”</p>
<p>“I am not calm,” I corrected him quietly. “I am focused. There is a
difference. Fear is a luxury. Save it for afterwards.”</p>
<p>A faint, grim smile touched his lips. “A lesson from your
mother?”</p>
<p>“A lesson from life,” I said, and finished my water. “St. Nicolaas
churchyard. Noon. Look like you belong there.”</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The churchyard of St. Nicolaas was an island of cramped silence in
the city’s hum. Ancient, leaning headstones jostled for space under the
skeletal arms of elm trees. We gathered by a moss-covered monument to a
long-dead burgomaster, our little conspiracy of the indebted, the
guilty, and the desperate.</p>
<p>Pieter was a live wire, jumping at every pigeon’s flutter. Gerrit was
a statue, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, his gaze fixed on the
gargoyle leering from the church’s gutter. I stood between them, the
point of the triangle, feeling the push and pull of their energies. The
tension wasn’t about the plan. It was in the space between us, in the
unspoken words that hung in the damp air.</p>
<p>“This is a mistake,” Pieter hissed, his eyes darting. “We should have
a lookout on the street. What if Dekker—”</p>
<p>“Dekker is a vulture,” I cut in, my voice low but absolute. “He
circles the obviously dying. We are not dying. We are working. Look at
you. You’re a tradesman accompanying a prospective client to the Silk
Guild. Act like it.” I turned to Gerrit. “And you. You’re a family
friend, providing a second opinion on quality. You have the bearing of a
man who knows things. Use it.”</p>
<p>Gerrit’s eyes met mine. “And you?”</p>
<p>“I am the client. A woman with a skill, seeking patronage. Nothing
more.” I adjusted the fold of my shawl, a simple, sturdy thing. “The
defenses are not locks and guards. They are glances and assumptions. A
woman alone is scrutinized. A woman with two men in tow is… explained.
We are using their assumptions as our cover. Now, breathe. And follow my
lead.”</p>
<p>We walked the short distance to the Guildhall in a tense, silent
file. The building was a statement in sandstone and arrogance, its
stepped gable adorned with stone swags of cloth and a gilded statue of
St. Nicholas himself, patron of merchants, looking benevolently down
upon his profitable flock. The great oak door was ajar, a mouth
promising both opportunity and digestion.</p>
<p>The moment we crossed the threshold, the atmosphere changed. The
noise of the city vanished, swallowed by thick walls and richer silence.
The air was different too; dry, carrying the faint, precious dust of
silk and wool, and the beeswax used to polish acres of dark wood. Light
fell in solemn shafts from high windows, illuminating portraits of
stern, lace-collared men who had built this empire with ledger and
loom.</p>
<p>A young clerk, his chin barely needing a razor, looked up from a high
desk. His eyes passed over Gerrit and Pieter, registering their presence
and dismissing them as necessary appendages. They settled on me. There
was a flicker—not of suspicion, but of a mild, bureaucratic curiosity. A
woman here was unusual, but not unprecedented. Wives of burghers
sometimes came. Widows managing estates. I was neither, and he knew it.
The calculation was in his pause.</p>
<p>“Mevrouw?” he said, the formal address a cautious probe.</p>
<p>“I have an appointment with Mijnheer de Witt. Regarding a sample.” I
kept my voice cool, devoid of the ingratiating warmth most women would
feel compelled to offer in such a hall.</p>
<p>He consulted a ledger, his finger tracing down a column. “Ah. Yes.
The… textile specialist.” He said it as if the words were in a foreign
language. “He is expecting you. The sample room. Hendrik will show you
up.”</p>
<p>An older man, with the perpetually stooped posture of a lifetime
spent carrying bolts of fabric, emerged from a side door. He nodded
wordlessly and led us up a wide, creaking staircase. Our footsteps were
muffled by a runner of fine Turkish carpet. The walls were lined with
glass-fronted cabinets displaying exquisite examples of the guild’s
work: a length of cloth-of-gold, a delicate point de Venise lace, an
embroidery so fine it looked like a painting.</p>
<p>It was a museum of value. A temple to commerce. And we were heretics,
walking its halls.</p>
<p>The sample room was on the second floor, a long, narrow space with a
wall of north-facing windows. The light was perfect, clinical, exposing
every fiber. Shelves and wide, flat drawers held thousands of swatches,
organized by origin, weave, and dye. The air here was even more potent,
a library of scents: the peppery smell of raw silk, the earthy depth of
madder, the metallic tang of indigo vats.</p>
<p>De Witt was not there. Instead, a man I recognized as his head clerk,
a thin man with ink-stained fingers and a permanent frown, stood by a
large table. On the table lay a single piece of fabric, covered by a
protective sheet of linen.</p>
<p>“Mevrouw,” the head clerk said, his tone neither welcoming nor
hostile. It was the tone of a man assessing a piece of machinery.
“Mijnheer de Witt is detained. He has asked me to oversee the initial
presentation. These are your… associates?”</p>
<p>“Advisors,” I said. “In matters of durability, and of aesthetic
suitability for the intended market.” I gestured to Pieter, then Gerrit.
The clerk’s frown deepened slightly at the inclusion of a tanner, but he
nodded. The logic—durability—was sound enough to pass without
comment.</p>
<p>“Very well. You may wait in the anteroom. The mevrouw will
demonstrate.” It was a dismissal, clear and crisp. The gender dynamic
was reasserting itself here, within the guild’s belly. I was the
specimen to be examined. The men, even my ragged allies, were granted
the space of the anteroom, a place of waiting and implied judgment.</p>
<p>Gerrit gave me a last, long look. Pieter just stared at the floor.
They filed out, leaving me alone with the clerk and the covered
sample.</p>
<p>“Proceed,” the clerk said.</p>
<p>I approached the table. My heart was a steady, heavy drum against my
ribs. This was the moment. The performance. I had to be flawless. I laid
my small toolkit on the table: my fine needles, my silks, my magnifying
lens, my scissors with blades like slivers of moon. Then, with a hand
that did not tremble, I drew back the linen cover.</p>
<p>The fabric beneath was a ruin.</p>
<p>It was a doublet front, once magnificent, of Italian cut-velvet. The
pattern was a complex pomegranate, the pile a deep, resonant black
against a cloth-of-silver ground. Or it had been. Now, a great, jagged
tear ran from the shoulder down to the waist, as if it had been caught
on a spear or a sharp branch. The velvet pile was matted with what
looked like old wine or blood. The silver threads were tarnished and
snapped. It was a deliberate insult. This wasn’t a test of skill. It was
a test of mettle. To give a woman, a supposed specialist, something so
violently damaged was to ask: do you even know where to begin?</p>
<p>The clerk watched me, his eyes noting the first reaction. I let none
show. I leaned over the fabric, not touching it, my eyes tracing the
wound. I picked up my lens. The damage was even worse under
magnification. The weave was stressed, the foundation threads frayed.
This wasn’t a simple tear; it was a collapse.</p>
<p>“The nature of the damage?” the clerk asked, his voice dry as the
sample-room dust.</p>
<p>“Traumatic,” I said, my own voice matching his in detachment.
“Followed by neglect. The contaminant is acidic. Wine, likely. It has
set the stain and accelerated the tarnishing of the metal thread.” I
looked up at him. “Mijnheer de Witt wishes this restored?”</p>
<p>“He wishes to see if restoration is possible. And to gauge the time
and cost such an endeavor would require from a… modestly resourced
practitioner.”</p>
<p>The barb was clear. I ignored it. “I will need to assess the
underlying structure. May I?” I gestured to my needle.</p>
<p>He gave a curt nod.</p>
<p>This was my element. The world narrowed to the space under my lens.
The clamor of fear, the pressure of the impending theft, the weight of
Gerrit’s doubt and Pieter’s fear—all of it receded. There was only the
problem, and the solution. I selected a needle, fine as a hair. With
infinite care, I teased apart a few threads at the edge of the tear,
probing the health of the cloth beneath. I tested the strength of the
velvet’s anchor threads. I examined the junction of the silver
brocade.</p>
<p>The work would be immense. It would require re-weaving sections from
the back, using a laying-in technique to rebuild the pile. The silver
threads would need to be individually cleaned and re-couched. The stain
might never fully lift, but it could be disguised with an in-painting of
dye on the individual threads. It would take weeks. It would be a
masterpiece of invisible mending.</p>
<p>And it was impossible. A fantasy. De Witt knew it. This sample was a
brick wall, presented to see if I would break my hands against it or
have the sense to walk away.</p>
<p>But walking away wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>I straightened. “It can be done.”</p>
<p>The clerk’s eyebrows lifted a fraction. “Indeed. And the time?”</p>
<p>“Forty hours of work. Perhaps fifty.”</p>
<p>“And the cost?”</p>
<p>I named a figure that was absurdly high, a sum for a master guildsman
working on a prince’s garment. It was a defensive move. If he balked,
the negotiation was over, and I could leave with my dignity. If he
accepted, the advance would be enough to buy Pieter’s debt three times
over.</p>
<p>He did not balk. He simply made a note in a small book. “Mijnheer de
Witt will consider it. He will give you his answer by the end of the
week. You may leave your card.”</p>
<p>I had no card. “I am lodging at De Visser’s. The message will find
me.”</p>
<p>A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. The address
confirmed every low expectation. “Very well.” He recovered the ruined
velvet. “Thank you for your assessment.”</p>
<p>The interview was over. I had passed, or failed, on terms I did not
yet understand. Now came the real test. I gathered my tools slowly,
deliberately, buying seconds. As I placed the last needle in its roll, I
let my hand brush against the edge of the table. A small, sharp splinter
caught the pad of my thumb. I drew in a quick breath, a tiny, pained
sound.</p>
<p>The clerk looked up. “Mevrouw?”</p>
<p>“A splinter,” I said, holding up my thumb. A bead of blood welled,
dark and perfect. “It is nothing. Forgive the disturbance.”</p>
<p>It was a woman’s weakness. A trivial, bodily complaint. His face
softened with a hint of impatience, of condescending pity. “There is a
basin in the anteroom. You may see to it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” I inclined my head, the picture of embarrassed
gratitude, and left the sample room, cradling my hand.</p>
<p>In the anteroom, Gerrit and Pieter were standing stiffly by the cold
fireplace. The under-clerk was there, leaning against the doorjamb to
the corridor, ostensibly keeping an eye on them. His attention, however,
was patently on the sound of female laughter drifting up from the
courtyard below—the new maid, no doubt.</p>
<p>My entrance broke the tableau. I went straight to the ceramic basin
and ewer in the corner. “A splinter,” I said, my voice slightly
breathless. “From the table. Clumsy of me.”</p>
<p>Pieter started forward, genuine concern on his face. Gerrit’s eyes
narrowed. He saw the performance.</p>
<p>“Allow me,” Gerrit said, his deep voice cutting through the room. He
stepped toward me, his bulk blocking the under-clerk’s view of both me
and Pieter. “I have better light here by the window. Pieter, fetch a
clean cloth from my bag.”</p>
<p>It was a clumsy, obvious diversion, but it worked because it was so
mundane, so predictably male—the big man taking charge of a woman’s
minor injury. The under-clerk glanced over, sighed at the fuss, and
turned his attention fully back to the window and the laughter
below.</p>
<p>It was the moment. The held breath.</p>
<p>Pieter, his face pale but set, didn’t go to Gerrit’s bag. Instead, he
took two silent steps to the anteroom door, the one that led not back to
the stairs, but deeper into the guildhall’s private warren. He paused,
his ear to the wood. Then, with a glance at me—I gave the slightest
nod—he turned the handle and slipped out.</p>
<p>The world stopped. Gerrit pretended to examine my thumb, his own
hands steady but cold. The splinter was real. The blood was real. The
sixty seconds that ticked by in the silent, wax-smelling room were an
eternity measured in heartbeats. I could hear the under-clerk humming
tunelessly. I could hear the distant, rhythmic thump from the
pile-drivers outside, a heartbeat for the city itself.</p>
<p>Then, a soft scrape at the door. It opened. Pieter slid back in, his
face sheened with a cold sweat, but his eyes alight with a fierce,
terrified triumph. His jacket, which had been loose before, now seemed
subtly, irrevocably fuller around his middle.</p>
<p>Gerrit released my hand. “There. It’s out.” He said it too
loudly.</p>
<p>I pressed the clean cloth to my thumb. “My thanks.” I turned to the
under-clerk. “We are finished here. Please convey my respects to
Mijnheer de Witt.”</p>
<p>The under-clerk, pulled from his reverie, straightened. “Of course.
This way.”</p>
<p>He led us back down the grand staircase, through the hushed hall, and
out into the startling cacophony of the street. The sunlight felt like
an interrogation. We did not speak. We did not look at each other. We
walked, a trio of perfectly normal people, away from the Guildhall,
around a corner, into another, and then into the dank, welcoming gloom
of a covered alley.</p>
<p>Only then, surrounded by the smell of wet stone and decay, did we
stop. Pieter leaned against the wall, his chest heaving. He fumbled
inside his jacket and drew it out: a bolt of silk, tightly rolled. It
was a crimson so deep it was almost black in the shadows, but where a
sliver of daylight caught it, it burned with the inner fire of a dying
star. Venetian crimson. The color of cardinals’ robes and courtesans’
lips. The color of blood and wealth.</p>
<p>Gerrit took it from him, his painter’s fingers stroking the surface
with a reverence that bordered on the erotic. “It’s perfect,” he
whispered. “The weight… the dye is flawless. Cochineal and kermes,
layered. A fortune.”</p>
<p>Pieter let out a sound that was half-sob, half-laugh. “It was there.
Just where you said. On the middle shelf, behind the inferior Flemish
stuff. The corridor was empty. It was… it was easy.”</p>
<p>“It was not easy,” I said, my voice cutting through their relief. The
adrenaline was draining from me, leaving a hollow, shaking cold behind.
“It was luck, and timing, and a man distracted by a maid’s laugh. Do not
confuse the outcome with the risk.” I took the bolt from Gerrit. It was
heavier than I expected. The silk seemed to pulse with a life of its
own, a stolen heart. “Now comes the hard part. Turning this into money
Dekker will accept, without him knowing its source.”</p>
<p>The dynamics had shifted again. In the alley, in the aftermath, we
were no longer client and advisors, nor even leader and followers. We
were accomplices. The silk in my hands was the proof of our shared
crime. It bound us in a new, terrible equality. Gerrit’s guilt was now
tangible. Pieter’s debt had a potential price. And my freedom had taken
its first, irrevocable step into the shadows.</p>
<p>But the shift was more profound than that. In the guildhall, I had
been the woman, the object of assessment, the one whose minor injury
became a tool. I had used their assumptions—of female fragility, of male
protectiveness—as the pick to break their lock. The system, the great,
male engine of commerce and power, had been momentarily fooled by the
very dynamics it insisted upon. I hadn’t broken a rule. I had used the
rulebook itself to hide the theft. The realization was a cold, bright
flame in my chest. Their world was a pattern, and I was learning to
weave myself into its design, not as a thread of gold, but as a flaw, a
subtle mis-weave that could unravel the whole.</p>
<p>“We split up,” I instructed, tucking the silk into my own bag,
beneath my shawl and toolkit. It made a slight, tell-tale bulge.
“Pieter, go back to the yard. Work. Be seen. Gerrit, go to your studio.
If anyone asks, we had a disappointing meeting. The sample was beyond
repair. De Witt was dismissive. We are dejected.”</p>
<p>“And you?” Gerrit asked, his eyes on the bag.</p>
<p>“I have a piece of silk to hide,” I said. “And a debt to plan the
payment of. We meet tomorrow night. De Visser’s back room. Not a minute
earlier.”</p>
<p>They nodded, two men taking orders from the woman who held the stolen
heart of a guild. They melted away into the alley’s different exits,
leaving me alone.</p>
<p>I did not go straight back to my room. I walked, the weight of the
silk a secret anchor against my ribs. I walked until the grandeur of the
guild district gave way to the cramped, gabled houses of the craftsmen,
and then to the wider, poorer streets near the harbor. The light was
fading, bleeding from grey to a dull orange at the edges of the cloud
cover.</p>
<p>I found myself at the base of the half-built new church, the one
whose pile-drivers had been the day’s heartbeat. The skeletal ribs of
its vaulting reached into the twilight like the bones of a leviathan. It
was a monument to ambition, to a future faith. I stood in its shadow,
looking back toward the city center, where the Guildhall’s gable was
just a darker notch against the sky.</p>
<p>The hook was no longer just set. It was buried deep. We had taken the
first, actual thing. The plan was no longer a pattern of thought in the
dark; it was a bolt of stolen crimson silk in my bag. The loose bar in
the cage had been tested, and it had held.</p>
<p>But as I turned finally toward my room, toward the tallow candle and
the locked chest, a new coldness settled in my stomach. Dekker’s men
would be watching Pieter. De Witt’s clerk would be making his report.
The <em>schout</em> in his large hat might, at this very moment, be
hearing a curious story about a woman with a splinter and two nervous
men. The city’s teeth were everywhere, yes. And now, we had placed our
own fingers between them.</p>
<p>The dark, when I finally reached it and bolted my door, did not feel
like a held breath anymore.</p>
<p>It felt like the moment after the trap has sprung, when the only
sound is the beating of your own heart in the silence, and the waiting
for the cry that tells you what, exactly, you have caught.</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="chapter-6-1"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></h2>
<p>The cold in my room had seeped into the brick, a patient, settled
kind of cold that no tallow flame could ever hope to shift. I sat on the
edge of my cot, the bolt of crimson silk a heavy, accusing presence on
the floor beside me. It was not a treasure. It was a timer, its silent
countdown measured in the beats of my own heart. The city’s teeth. We
had felt them, and now we waited for the bite.</p>
<p>Sleep was a fractured thing, a series of shallow dips into black
water where the faces of Dekker and De Witt and the <em>schout</em> swam
like pale, bloated fish. I woke before dawn, the taste of metal on my
tongue, the phantom weight of the silk still pressed against my ribs.
The plan for the meeting in De Visser’s back room was a neat, logical
thing in my head—distribution, payment, the next target—but logic felt
like a child’s drawing over a crack in the ice. Beneath it, the dark
water shifted.</p>
<p>I spent the morning in a state of deliberate stillness, a creature
playing dead. I mended a tear in my only other shirt, the needle moving
with a mechanical precision that required no thought. I watched the
slice of sky outside my high window bleed from black to grey to a sour,
milk-white. The normal sounds of the city—carts on cobbles, the distant
call of gulls, the shouts of hawkers—felt like a performance, a play put
on for my benefit. Every raised voice was a warning. Every silence, a
threat.</p>
<p>By the time the light began to fail again, the stillness had become a
cage. I needed to move. The meeting was hours away, but the thought of
sitting in this room with the silk any longer was intolerable. I would
go to De Visser early. I would sit in the main room, drink a small beer,
and listen. Information was a currency, and the pub was a mint.</p>
<p>I wrapped the silk in a piece of sacking, then wrapped that in my
spare blanket, creating a shapeless, lumpen bundle. It looked like
laundry, the kind of poor man’s burden no one glanced at twice. I left
my room, the lock clicking shut with a finality that echoed in the empty
stairwell.</p>
<hr />
<p>The rain had returned, not the spiteful hurling of before, but a
fine, persistent drizzle that beaded on the wool of my coat and made the
cobbles slick as eel-skin. The walk to De Visser was a study in
peripheral vision. I noted the baker’s boy lingering too long at a
corner, the two porters who seemed to be having the same muttered
argument outside three different warehouses. Were they Dekker’s? The
<em>schout’s</em>? Or just men having a bad day? The uncertainty was the
point. It was the grindstone against which my nerves were being
sharpened.</p>
<p>I pushed into the pub. The warmth was less of a blow this time, more
a suffocating blanket. The same smells—sour beer, brine, sweat—but the
crowd was thinner, earlier. A few regulars hunched over tables, their
conversations a low, private rumble. The barman, a slab-faced man with
forearms like cured hams, gave me a nod that was neither welcome nor
dismissal. I had become a fixture, then. A woman who came in alone, who
drank little, who watched. It was a dangerous kind of recognition.</p>
<p>I took a seat in a corner where my back was to the wall, the bundled
silk on the bench beside me. I ordered a beer. As I waited, my eyes
traced the grain of the wooden table, the rings of countless glasses
etched into its surface. A door behind the bar, low and narrow, led to
the back room. Our room. For now, it was just a door.</p>
<p>My beer arrived. I was raising it to my lips when the main door
opened again, letting in a gust of wet, cold air and a man.</p>
<p>He was not one of Dekker’s bruisers. He was not a guildsman in fine
wool. He was tall, lean, dressed in a dark, serviceable coat that was
too clean for the docks but not fine enough for the guild district. His
hat was pulled low, shadowing his face, but it was the way he moved that
stopped the breath in my throat. A fluid, economical grace, like a man
who knew the exact dimensions of every space he entered and how to
dominate it. He didn’t look around; he simply absorbed the room, his
gaze a physical sweep that touched the barman, the regulars, the
shadows, and finally, me.</p>
<p>He held my eyes for a half-second longer than was casual. Then he
walked to the bar, not with purpose, but with an inevitability, like
water finding a drain. He leaned against it, spoke a few low words to
the barman. A glass of clear liquor appeared before him. He did not
drink it. He turned, leaning back on his elbows, and surveyed the room
again. His face was angular, sharp-planed, clean-shaven. His eyes were
the colour of the slate sky outside.</p>
<p>He was a hunter. And I was suddenly, utterly sure that I was the
game.</p>
<p>The low murmur of the pub seemed to recede, replaced by the loud,
frantic drum of my own pulse in my ears. This was the fear. Not the
bluster of Dekker, not the cold bureaucracy of De Witt. This was the
quiet, professional attention of the city’s true mechanism. The
<em>schout’s</em> man. Or something worse. The teeth, given form and
focus.</p>
<p>I forced my hand to be steady as I set my beer down. The urge to run
was a live wire in my muscles. To bolt for the door, to lose myself in
the maze of alleys. But the bundle of silk was a beacon beside me.
Running would be confession. Staying was a gamble, a test of nerve
against his.</p>
<p>He pushed off from the bar. He did not walk toward me. He walked to a
vacant table midway between the door and my corner, and sat. He took a
slow sip of his liquor, his eyes never leaving the middle distance, but
his awareness was a net cast over the entire room. Over me.</p>
<p>Time stretched, taut and thin. Every scrape of a chair, every cough,
was a gunshot. I calculated the distance to the back room door. Could I
reach it before he did? Would it even be unlocked? Pieter and Maarten
were not due for hours. I was alone, with the evidence, in a trap that
had just been sprung.</p>
<p>Then he moved again. Not toward me. He stood, left a coin on his
table, and walked out into the drizzle. The door swung shut behind
him.</p>
<p>The release of pressure was so violent it felt like a blow. I sucked
in a breath, my lungs burning. He was gone. Had it been a test? A
routine check? A warning?</p>
<p>I looked down at my hands. They were trembling. I clenched them into
fists, the nails biting into my palms. The sharp pain grounded me. This
was the crisis. Not a fight in an alley, but this silent, screaming
confrontation with the sheer, exposed reality of what we were doing. The
enemy was not a person. It was the eye of the city, and it had just
blinked, slowly, in my direction.</p>
<p>I could not stay here. The back room was compromised. This whole
place was now a painted target. I had to move the silk. I had to warn
the others.</p>
<p>I stood, grabbing the bundled blanket. My legs felt unsteady, as if
the floorboards had turned to sand. I tossed a coin onto my table and
made for the door, my walk a careful, measured thing I hoped looked
nothing like the flight it was.</p>
<p>The drizzle had thickened into a proper rain. I turned away from the
main thoroughfare, plunging into a narrow alley that stank of wet rot
and cat piss. My mind raced. Where? The room was out—if he could find me
at De Visser, he could find my lodgings. The half-built church? Too
exposed.</p>
<p>A hand closed over my mouth from behind. An arm like an iron bar
locked around my chest, crushing the breath from me, lifting me off my
feet. The bundled silk fell from my grip, landing in the filthy alley
muck with a soft thud.</p>
<p>I thrashed, a silent, frantic animal, my boots scraping against the
wet bricks. I tried to bite the gloved hand, to drive my elbows back,
but his strength was absolute, a machine of bone and muscle. He dragged
me backward, deeper into the alley’s gloom, away from the faint light of
the street.</p>
<p>This was the defeat. Not a fair fight, not a contest of wits. This
was the brutal, efficient snuffing of a candle. The city’s teeth,
closing. My greatest fear, given arms and breath. I had walked right
into it.</p>
<p>He hauled me into a recessed doorway, the space so tight his body
pressed me against the rotten wood. His mouth was near my ear. His
breath smelled of the liquor and of cloves.</p>
<p>“Be still,” he said, his voice a low rasp, devoid of anger or
urgency. It was an instruction. “I am not going to hurt you. Yet.”</p>
<p>I went limp, not in surrender, but to make him bear my full weight.
He adjusted his grip, just slightly. It was the opening I needed.</p>
<p>I stopped fighting his pull. Instead, I let my head fall back, as if
in a faint. Then, with every ounce of strength left in my neck and
shoulders, I snapped my head forward and immediately back again. The
back of my skull connected with his face with a sickening, wet
crunch.</p>
<p>He grunted, a sound of pure surprise and pain. His grip loosened for
a fraction of a second. I drove my heel down onto his instep, not the
delicate stamp of a lady, but the full, grinding weight of a body used
to hard floors and long walks.</p>
<p>He swore, his arm unlocking. I tore free, spinning, slipping on the
wet stones. He was already recovering, a dark line of blood from his
nose stark against his pale skin. His eyes, those slate-coloured eyes,
were no longer cool. They were alive with a deadly, focused light.</p>
<p>There was no time to retrieve the silk. No time for anything but
survival.</p>
<p>I ran.</p>
<p>Not out to the street, where he could easily corner me. I ran deeper
into the alley, into the labyrinth. I heard his footsteps behind me,
swift and sure despite his injuries. I turned a corner, then another, my
breath sobbing in my throat. The alleys were a tangled web, but I had
walked them for weeks. I knew where the dead ends were. I knew where the
fences could be scaled.</p>
<p>I skidded into a courtyard piled with broken crates. A high wall on
three sides. A dead end. I heard his footsteps slow behind me,
approaching the entrance. He knew it, too.</p>
<p>I did not hesitate. I scrambled onto the crates, the wood slick and
splintered. My fingers clawed at the top of the wall, finding purchase
on wet brick. I hauled myself up, my muscles screaming. I swung a leg
over, just as he entered the courtyard. He didn’t shout. He simply
lunged, a predator’s final, efficient pounce.</p>
<p>His hand closed around my ankle. His grip was a manacle. He began to
pull.</p>
<p>I looked down at him, his face a mask of blood and intent in the
gloom. I had one free leg. I had the wall. And I had the memory of a
thousand small indignities, a lifetime of being the one who was grabbed,
held, dismissed, cornered.</p>
<p>I did not try to kick free. Instead, I used his own pull as leverage.
I braced my other foot against the wall and pushed <em>with</em> him,
hurling myself backward off the wall, directly at him.</p>
<p>He was not expecting it. A man expects a woman to pull away, to
struggle in the direction of freedom. He does not expect her to fly into
his arms.</p>
<p>We crashed to the filthy cobbles together, a tangle of limbs. The
impact drove the air from his lungs. I was on top of him for a split
second, a reversal so complete it was dizzying. My hand found a piece of
broken crate—a splintered length of wood, heavy and sharp. I didn’t
think. I drove it down.</p>
<p>He moved his head at the last instant. The wood struck the cobble
beside his temple with a crack, sending a jolt up my arm. But a long,
wicked splinter had sheared off. And it was now pressed against the soft
skin under his jaw, my weight behind it.</p>
<p>We were both still, breathing in ragged gasps. The rain fell on us,
mingling with the blood on his face. I could feel the frantic beat of
his pulse through the wood in my hand.</p>
<p>“The silk is worthless,” I hissed, the words torn from me. “It’s a
decoy. Stuffed with rags. You’ve caught nothing.”</p>
<p>His eyes searched mine. Looking for the lie. I held his gaze, letting
him see the fury, the fear, the absolute conviction. It was a gamble
born of pure, desperate ingenuity. The real silk was lying in an alley a
hundred yards away. But if he believed me, the prize was gone. I became
a woman with a splinter, not a thief with a fortune.</p>
<p>A long moment passed. The tension in his body, coiled to throw me
off, slowly ebbed. Not all the way. But enough.</p>
<p>“Who are you working for?” he asked, his voice still that terrifying
calm rasp.</p>
<p>“Myself,” I said. It was the only answer that might make sense of a
woman alone in an alley with a fake bolt of silk.</p>
<p>He gave a slow, bloody smile. It was the most frightening thing I had
seen yet. “No,” he said softly. “You’re not.”</p>
<p>With a sudden, explosive motion, he bucked his hips, throwing me
sideways. The splinter scored a line across his neck as I fell, but it
was a shallow cut. He was on his feet in an instant, backing toward the
courtyard entrance, a hand to his bleeding neck. He didn’t come for me
again.</p>
<p>“A decoy,” he said, nodding as if confirming something. “Clever. Tell
your ‘self’ that the eye is open. And it blinks less often than you
think.”</p>
<p>Then he was gone, melting into the alley shadows as if he were made
of them.</p>
<p>I lay on the cold, wet stones, the piece of shattered crate still
clutched in my hand. The tremors took me then, great, wracking shudders
that had nothing to do with the cold. I had faced the enemy. I had been
caught. And I had talked my way out of the trap, not with a lie he
believed, but with a lie he found interesting enough to follow. It was
not a victory. It was a stay of execution.</p>
<p>But I was alive. And the silk was still out there.</p>
<p>I forced myself to stand. Every part of me ached. I retraced my
steps, moving like a ghost through the alleys. The bundled blanket lay
where I had dropped it, half-submerged in a murky puddle. I snatched it
up, holding the sodden, filthy thing to my chest. The reward. Not for a
victory, but for survival. The knowledge it represented was cold and
sharp: our time had just shrunk to a pinprick. The hunter knew my face.
He knew we were more than one. And he was not fooled.</p>
<p>I could not go to De Visser. I could not go home. There was only one
place left.</p>
<p>I made my way to the craftsmen’s district, to the small, tidy
workshop of Gerrit the dyer. It was shut up for the night, but a faint
glow came from the living quarters above. I threw a handful of gravel at
the window.</p>
<p>After a minute, the door cracked open. Klaas’s face, pale and
anxious, appeared. He saw the state of me—soaked, filthy, shaking—and
his eyes widened. He pulled me inside without a word.</p>
<p>In the low-ceilinged room upstairs, by the light of a single oil
lamp, I told them. Pieter and Maarten had arrived early, their faces
hardening to stone as I spoke. I told them of the man at De Visser, the
chase, the fight in the courtyard, the lie of the decoy. I unwrapped the
blanket. The sacking was soaked, but the crimson silk inside was
pristine, a shocking, vibrant wound of colour in the drab room.</p>
<p>“He’s City Guard,” Pieter said finally, his voice hollow. “Not
<em>schout</em>. Higher. The kind they send when the guilds whisper and
money goes quiet.”</p>
<p>“He’s hunting,” Maarten said, stating the obvious that hung in the
air like smoke.</p>
<p>“We change everything,” I said, my own voice surprising me with its
flat steadiness. “The meeting place. The drop for the silk. The next
target. We move not tomorrow, but now. Tonight.”</p>
<p>They looked at me, these two men who had taken orders from a woman.
In their eyes, I saw no doubt now. Only a grim reflection of my own
resolve. The setback was complete. The plan was in ashes. But from the
ashes, we had pulled this one, vital thing: the silk, and the certainty
of the hunt.</p>
<p>“What do we do?” Klaas asked, his voice small.</p>
<p>I looked at the bolt of crimson. It was no longer just a commodity.
It was a flag. A challenge. And it was the only piece of the board we
still controlled.</p>
<p>“We use what we have,” I said. “We finish what we started. But we do
it faster, and we do it meaner. He thinks he’s chasing a woman with a
splinter. We’ll show him the whole damned tree.”</p>
<p>I assigned new roles, new meeting points in a code of street names
and tradesmen’s marks. The silk would be broken apart, hidden in three
different dye vats in Gerrit’s workshop, transformed from a bolt into a
potential, its colour leaching into other cloth, becoming invisible. We
would not sell it whole. We would sell the <em>idea</em> of it, to
Dekker’s rivals, in whispers.</p>
<p>As they left, one by one, to carry their new orders into the wet
night, I was left alone with Pieter. He hesitated at the door.</p>
<p>“He saw you,” he said. “He’ll find you.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said.</p>
<p>“You should leave the city.”</p>
<p>“And go where?” I asked. It wasn’t a question for him. The city was
the cage. But it was also the only world I knew how to fight in.</p>
<p>After he was gone, I sat by the cooling lamp. The adrenaline had
burned away, leaving a crystalline clarity. The fear was still there,
the cold in my stomach. But it had a shape now. A face the colour of
slate. It was a thing I could outthink. Maybe.</p>
<p>I had earned no rest. No safe haven. I had earned a war. And as I
listened to the first bells of the night watch sound through the
dripping dark, I understood the new silence. It was not the moment after
the trap has sprung.</p>
<p>It was the moment you pick up the trap yourself, study its mechanism,
and begin to reset it, your own fingers careful around the cold, sharp
steel.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-7-1"><strong>Chapter 7</strong></h2>
<p>The victory tasted of copper and cheap gin. Not the good,
juniper-sharp kind from the dockside warehouses, but the raw,
throat-scouring spirit Gerrit distilled in a back room behind his vats.
We drank it from chipped ceramic cups, the liquid a pale ghost in the
lamplight of the workshop. The air was thick with the humid, chemical
breath of dye—indigo, weld, the sharp bite of madder—and beneath it, the
sweet, cloying rot of wet wool.</p>
<p>“To the tree,” Pieter said, raising his cup. His knuckles were
scraped raw, the skin peeling back like old varnish.</p>
<p>“To the splinter,” Klaas countered, a faint, grim smile on his face.
He’d lost a tooth in the scuffle at the warehouse. The gap gave his
words a soft, whistling quality.</p>
<p>We drank. The gin was a fire in a gut already lined with ash. It was
not a celebration of triumph, but a ritual of survival. We had done the
impossible. We had taken a piece of Dekker’s world, carved it out from
under his slate-coloured gaze, and made it ours. The bulk of the crimson
silk was gone now, dissolved into three separate vats of brewing colour.
A length of it, however, lay across the scarred worktable between us, a
narrow river of impossible red in the gloom. Our reward. Our proof.</p>
<p>“For the widow,” I said, my voice cutting through the low murmur. I
ran a finger along the edge. The weave was so fine it felt like cool
smoke. “And for the boy’s apprenticeship. The rest goes back into the
pot. For the next thing.”</p>
<p>Nods all around. No dissent. The money the silk would bring—sold in
careful, untraceable fragments to a Flemish merchant Pieter knew—was a
lifeline. It was also a leash. It bound us tighter. The shared risk had
become a shared asset. I saw the understanding in their eyes, the men
who had, weeks ago, tolerated my presence as a peculiarity of their
drowned comrade. Now they looked at me, and then at the silk, and the
two things were entwined. I was the plan. The silk was its blood.</p>
<p>Gerrit refilled the cups. “He’ll be turning the city inside out,” he
said, not looking up from the bottle.</p>
<p>“Let him,” I said. “He’s looking for a bolt of cloth. He won’t find
it. He’s looking for a woman hiding. He won’t find that, either.”</p>
<p>The words were braver than the feeling. The cold in my stomach had
not left; it had merely been joined by the gin’s false warmth. I had
stood in Dekker’s office and seen the calculation in his eyes, the way
he assessed me not as a person, but as a variable in a ledger. A
variable that had now proven volatile. He would not make the same
mistake twice.</p>
<p>We drank again, to silence. The celebration was a bare, spare thing.
A few more words about the Flemish merchant’s route, about the signals
to use. Then, one by one, they slipped out into the alley—Pieter to his
nets, Klaas to his sister’s tavern, Gerrit to bank the fire under the
vats. Each departure was a subtraction of warmth, of solidity. I was
left with the length of silk and the deepening quiet.</p>
<p>It was only then, in the solitary lamplight, that the cost presented
its invoice.</p>
<p>My body was a ledger of bruises. A tight, purple ache across my ribs
where a crate had been shoved against me. A stiffness in my shoulder
that spoke of a wrench I hadn’t felt in the adrenaline. But these were
entries I expected. The real cost came with the memory of Klaas’s face,
just before he left.</p>
<p>He’d paused at the door, the whistling gap in his smile gone. “My
sister,” he’d said, the words flat. “The tavern. He knows my face now.
If he presses… if they come asking…”</p>
<p>He didn’t finish. He didn’t need to. I had pulled him deeper into the
current, and now the undertow was threatening his shore. His loyalty,
bought with my promise of a better cut, was now a chain that could drag
his family down. I had seen the fear in his eyes, not for himself, but
for her. It was a fear I had weaponized. I’d given a brisk nod, a
commander’s assurance. “We’ll see to it. New locks. A boy to watch the
back.”</p>
<p>But the assurance was cheap tin. Dekker didn’t need to break down a
door. A word to the right official, a sudden inspection for vermin or a
review of a liquor license, could shutter a place like that forever. The
compromise wasn’t in the act of theft; it was in the quiet, spreading
poison of consequence. I had asked for soldiers and created
hostages.</p>
<p>I folded the silk. Its beauty felt accusatory.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dekker did not rage. Rage was for smaller men, for those who could
afford the luxury of lost control. He sat in the back room of a
grain-shipper’s office near the Oostelijke Handelskade, a place that
smelled of dust and distant, dry places. The man opposite him, a
narrow-faced expediter named Rens, had just finished his report. The
warehouse was secure. The guards had been replaced. The missing ledger
had been reconstructed from duplicate slips. The inventory discrepancy
was listed as water damage, vermin.</p>
<p>“And the woman?” Dekker asked. His voice was like a stone smoothed by
a river.</p>
<p>Rens shifted. This was the part of the report that was not neat, not
containable. “She has… connections. The waterfront. The old <em>De
Visser</em> crowd. They’ve closed ranks. We’ve asked. No one has seen
anything. No one knows anything.”</p>
<p>“Asking,” Dekker said, “is the invitation to lie.” He picked up a
paperweight—a lump of raw Baltic amber with a fly trapped inside,
forever striving. “We have moved from asking to reminding. Remind them
who holds the leases on their cottages. Who grants the permits for their
carts. Who decides which fishing boats get priority at the unloading
quays. Apply pressure. Not to the woman. To the water she swims in.”</p>
<p>He set the amber down. “The silk is secondary. It is a symbol. She
took it to prove she could. To prove <em>I</em> could be made a fool of.
That is the infection. That is what must be cauterized.”</p>
<p>Rens understood. The object was less important than the precedent. A
woman, a nobody from the drowned districts, had orchestrated a strike
against his network. She had used his own men’s assumptions—their
blindness to a woman as anything but a nuisance or a convenience—as her
primary tool. It was an insult that transcended material loss. It was a
challenge to the natural order of things, to the silent, agreed-upon
architecture of power that kept the city’s engine turning. If it were
seen to succeed, if it were allowed to stand, it would be a seed. Others
might water it.</p>
<p>“Find the point of her leverage,” Dekker continued, his eyes on the
frozen fly. “Everyone has one. A person. A place. A secret. She has made
herself a splinter. Very well. We will not grab for her. We will press
the flesh around her until she is forced out.”</p>
<p>His forces were not regrouping. They were shifting strategy, becoming
less a fist and more a vise. The hunt was no longer for a stolen good.
It was for a point of weakness. And Dekker had a lifetime of finding
those.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Flemish merchant’s money was a solid weight in the hidden pocket
of my skirt. I stood on the widow’s doorstep, a basket over my arm. The
street was a canal of mud, the houses leaning against each other like
tired old men. The door opened a crack, then wider when she saw it was
me. Her face, pale and drawn, was a map of sleepless nights.</p>
<p>“I have it,” I said, low, and didn’t step inside. The less she knew,
the less she could betray, even unwillingly. I passed her a small, heavy
pouch. “For the rent. For the boy’s fee with the ship’s carpenter. It’s
settled.”</p>
<p>Her fingers closed over the leather. They were trembling. She didn’t
look inside. She looked at my face, and her eyes filled not with
gratitude, but with a kind of terrified awe. “They came around. Two men.
Asking after you. Asking if you’d been here, if you’d left
anything.”</p>
<p>The cold in my stomach crystallized. “What did you say?”</p>
<p>“I said you were a friend of my husband’s. That you brought soup when
I was ill. That I hadn’t seen you in weeks.” The words came out in a
rehearsed rush. “They… they believed me, I think. They were polite.”</p>
<p>Polite. That was worse. It meant they were being careful. It meant
this was not a blunt search. It was a tracing of contours. Dekker was
applying pressure to the water.</p>
<p>“Good,” I said, the word ash in my mouth. “That’s all you ever say. I
won’t come back like this again.”</p>
<p>“Is it over?” she whispered, a desperate hope flaring in her
eyes.</p>
<p>I thought of the vise, tightening. I thought of Klaas’s sister. I
thought of the silent, spreading search that asked polite questions.
“The first part is,” I said. It was not a lie, but it was not the truth
she wanted. I turned to go, then stopped. From my basket, I took a small
parcel, wrapped in plain, grey wool. “For you. Not to sell. For
you.”</p>
<p>She unwrapped the corner. A flash of crimson, like a heartbeat in the
grey afternoon. A scarf’s worth of the silk. She gasped, her free hand
flying to her mouth. She hadn’t touched colour that wasn’t drab or faded
in years. It was wealth. It was beauty. It was a flag, planted in the
mud of her life.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” she breathed.</p>
<p>“You can,” I said. “Hide it. But know it’s there.”</p>
<p>As I walked away, the true value of the reward finally clarified
itself in my mind. It was not the money, though that was a tool. It was
not the victory, though that was a fuel. The silk, in that moment, was
something else entirely. For the widow, it was a reminder that the world
contained things other than grey struggle. For Dekker, it was a symbol
of defiance to be crushed. For me, standing in the mud, feeling the eyes
of the street upon my back, it had become a measure.</p>
<p>It was the measure of the distance between what we were and what we
dared to touch. It was the bright, dangerous line we had crossed. The
reward was not the object. The reward was the clarity. The understanding
that from now on, every choice would be between the mud and the silk,
and that choosing the silk meant living with the fact that you would get
both, forever stained together. The beauty and the hunt were now the
same thing.</p>
<p>I did not go home. The room over the cooper’s yard was a box to be
opened by men with polite questions. I had other holes to disappear
into, paid for with coin from a different, older job. As I moved through
the thickening twilight, the city felt different. The familiar brick and
mist were now a chessboard. The calls of the night watch, the glow from
tavern windows, the silhouettes of men in doorways—all were pieces in a
game I had forced into play.</p>
<p>The silence I had felt at the chapter’s start was gone. In its place
was a new sound: the low, almost imperceptible hum of tension, like a
wire pulled taut across the dark. Dekker was pressing on the flesh
around me. He would find a soft spot. He would press harder.</p>
<p>And I, with the taste of copper and gin still on my tongue and the
memory of crimson against grey wool, would have to decide which piece of
the board I was willing to sacrifice next, before the vise closed
shut.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-8-1"><strong>Chapter 8</strong></h2>
<p>The rain had returned, but it was a different animal now. Not the
spiteful, horizontal needling of before, but a slow, soaking drizzle
that seeped rather than struck. It turned the cobbles into a dark
mirror, reflecting the bruised purple of the twilight sky and the
occasional blurred yolk of a gas lamp. I kept to the middles of the
narrower streets, away from the doorways. Doorways held shapes. Shapes
had intentions.</p>
<p>My safe hole was in the Veemkade, a warehouse district that smelled
perpetually of wet hemp and rotting fruit. The room was paid for, a cash
transaction with a landlord who asked no questions and heard nothing. It
was a coffin with a window, overlooking a canal the colour of dishwater.
It represented a backward step, a return to the gristle of life before
the silk. But the room over the cooper’s yard was a known quantity now,
and in this new arithmetic, known quantities were liabilities.</p>
<p>I crossed the Blaak, the open square feeling like a naked expanse.
The statue of the old scholar in the centre was a black spike against
the sky. My footsteps echoed too loudly. I slowed, not to quiet them,
but to listen for an echo that didn’t match my own. The low hum from the
chapter’s end was no longer a wire in the distance. It was the blood in
my own ears.</p>
<p>A sharper sound cut through the drizzle: a boot scuffing on wet
stone, off to the right and behind. Not the random shuffle of a drunk.
It was placed, a testing of the ground. I didn’t turn. I altered my
course, not towards the Veemkade, but into the labyrinth of the Oude
Haven. The chessboard was not abstract. The pieces were moving.</p>
<p>The old harbour was a snarl of leaning gables, net-menders’ sheds,
and taverns that were little more than holes in the wall. The air was
thick with the smell of fish guts and wet tar. It offered shadows,
angles, unpredictability. I ducked under a low-slung pulley, its hook
swinging empty, and slipped into the gap between two tall warehouses.
The passage was a slit of darkness, the ground underfoot a slurry of mud
and discarded shells.</p>
<p>I stopped, my back against the cold, rough brick. Silence, save for
the drip from a broken gutter and the distant cry of a gull. Then, the
footsteps again. Two pairs. Deliberate. They paused at the mouth of the
passage. A low murmur, male. I knew the tone. It was the sound of
coordination. Of the hunt.</p>
<p>Dekker was pressing. He’d found a soft spot—my pattern, my known
haunts—and he was pressing hard. But he was sending men. He wasn’t here
himself. That was a message, too. I was not yet worth his personal
attention. I was a stray to be rounded up by the kennel master. The
thought was a dry, hot coal in my chest.</p>
<p>I moved deeper into the passage. It opened onto a small, neglected
dock where a single barge, half-sunk, listed against the pilings like a
tired beast. The only way out was back the way I came, or across the
dock and over a low fence into a timber yard. The fence was spiked. The
men would be at the passage mouth in seconds.</p>
<p>The mud and the silk. The choice was never clean.</p>
<p>I took three quick steps and launched myself at the side of the
sinking barge. The rotted wood groaned under my hands, but held. I
hauled myself onto its slanted deck, the world tilting, and scrambled
towards its far side, away from the passage. My coat snagged on a rusted
cleat, the sound a vulgar rip in the quiet. I froze, crouched in the lee
of the small deckhouse.</p>
<p>The two men emerged from the passage. They were silhouettes, broad in
the shoulders, hats pulled low. They paused, scanning the dock. One
pointed to the fresh gouge in the mud where I’d jumped. His head
swivelled towards the barge.</p>
<p>“Come on out,” he called. His voice was calm, professional. It wasn’t
a shout. It was an invitation to be reasonable. “Just a talk. Mijnheer
Dekker has some questions.”</p>
<p>The use of the name was a tactic. It was meant to paralyse, to make
the threat official, inescapable. I said nothing. The drizzle painted a
fine film on the worn planks before me.</p>
<p>The other man, quieter, began to move along the dock, flanking wide.
He’d cut off the timber yard route. The first man stepped onto the
barge. The whole structure let out a low moan. He drew a short, thick
club from his coat. Not a knife. Dekker wanted me able to answer
questions.</p>
<p>The maths was simple. One on the barge, one on the dock. The one on
the barge was the immediate problem. I let him take two more steps, let
him commit his weight to the unstable deck. As he passed a coiled,
sodden hawser, I moved.</p>
<p>I didn’t go for him. I went for the coil of rope. I kicked it hard,
sending it unspooling and snaking across the deck towards his boots. It
was a trivial thing, a moment of distraction. He glanced down, his step
faltering. It was all the tilt the world needed. I closed the distance,
not with a fighter’s grace, but with the direct, inelegant force of a
door being slammed. I drove my shoulder into his chest, just as the
barge shifted again beneath us.</p>
<p>He grunted, arms wheeling for balance. The club flew from his hand,
splashing into the black water. He was bigger, heavier. But the tilted
deck was my ally. He stumbled backward, his heel catching on the very
rope I’d kicked. He fell with a crash that shook the barge, his head
connecting with the deckhouse wall with a damp thud. He went still, a
sack of potatoes in the rain.</p>
<p>The man on the dock swore, a sharp, guttural word. He started
forward, not running, but with a quick, purposeful stride. He pulled a
knife from his belt. The blade caught a sliver of distant light. The
rules had changed. The flanker had become the primary.</p>
<p>I was on the high side of the barge, him on the dock below. He had
the knife. I had the angle. He stepped closer, within striking distance.
I saw his eyes, flat and calculating. He was waiting for me to panic, to
try and jump for the timber yard fence.</p>
<p>Instead, I dropped. Not down, but sideways, letting the steep tilt of
the deck do the work. I slid down the wet planks, feet first, directly
towards him. It was not an attack. It was a collision. My boots slammed
into his shoulder and chest before he could bring the knife up. He
staggered back, but didn’t go down. He was good. He regained his
footing, the knife coming up in a clean, practised arc.</p>
<p>I was on my back on the cold stones of the dock, the wind knocked out
of me. He stood over me, a dark column against the sky. No words this
time. The invitation was rescinded.</p>
<p>Then, from the passage mouth, a new voice. Light, curious, and
utterly out of place.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem, gentlemen?”</p>
<p>The man with the knife froze. His eyes flicked towards the sound. So
did mine.</p>
<p>A woman stood there. She was wrapped in a sensible, dark wool cloak,
a market basket over her arm. Her hair was tucked under a plain cap. She
looked like a hundred other women finishing their evening errands. But
no errand brought anyone here. And her voice held no fear, only a mild,
inquisitive interest.</p>
<p>The man on the dock made a decision. I was on the ground. The witness
was a woman. A minor complication. He turned his head slightly towards
her, the knife hand lowering a fraction. “Piss off. This doesn’t concern
you.”</p>
<p>It was the fraction I needed. I scissored my legs, sweeping his out
from under him. He fell hard, the knife skittering away. I was on him
before he could breathe, my knee in his back, my own smaller, sharper
knife—the one I kept in my boot, the one for cutting rope, for eating
with, for moments like this—pressed against the side of his throat, just
below the jaw.</p>
<p>“It seems to concern me,” I said, my voice a rasp in his ear.</p>
<p>I looked up at the woman. She hadn’t moved. She watched, her head
tilted, as if observing a peculiar species of bird. Her gaze met mine.
There was no sisterhood in it, no solidarity. It was pure, clinical
assessment.</p>
<p>“He said Mijnheer Dekker has questions,” I said to her, the words a
test.</p>
<p>She nodded once, as if this confirmed a hypothesis. “Then you should
not linger.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“A neighbour.” She said it simply. Then she did something
inexplicable. She walked forward, past us, stepped neatly onto the
listing barge, and peered at the unconscious man. She prodded him with
the toe of her shoe. “This one will have a headache. The other will have
a grievance.” She looked back at me. “You are in my way.”</p>
<p>I stared at her. The knife-hand beneath me was breathing in shallow,
furious gasps. The hum of tension had found a new frequency, one I
didn’t understand. This woman was an obstacle, but not the one I’d
anticipated. She was a stone in the stream, changing the flow
entirely.</p>
<p>I leaned close to the man’s ear. “Tell Dekker his men need better
footing.” I stood up, releasing him, but keeping my knife in hand. He
scrambled to his feet, his face a mask of fury and humiliation. He
looked from me to the woman, who was now calmly waiting for him to move
from her path. The sheer, bizarre normality of her stance seemed to
unman him more than the fight. He retrieved his knife, shot me a last,
venomous look, and went to haul his companion from the barge.</p>
<p>They stumbled back down the passage, a four-legged creature of
defeat. The dock was silent again, save for the drizzle and the lap of
water against the pilings.</p>
<p>The woman stepped off the barge and adjusted her basket. She made to
walk past me.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked. The word hung in the wet air.</p>
<p>She stopped. She had a plain face, neither young nor old, with eyes
the colour of the slate sky. “This is my dock. I collect mussels from
the pilings when the tide is out. You were making a mess of it.” She
said it with the utter conviction of someone stating the most obvious
fact in the world. “Also, Dekker is a pig. He employs louder pigs.” A
faint, almost imperceptible curl touched her lip. “I dislike the
noise.”</p>
<p>And with that, she walked away, disappearing into the warren of sheds
as if she were a shadow retreating with the sun.</p>
<p>I stood there, the adrenaline bleeding away, leaving a cold, sharp
clarity. The chase had been disrupted, not ended. Dekker’s men would
report. The woman, the ‘neighbour’, was a variable. I had gained a
moment, not an escape.</p>
<p>The path to the Veemkade was compromised. They would expect that. The
ordinary world was not a place you could simply return to. It had been
annexed, its borders patrolled. I thought of the widow, the silk hidden
in her grey wool. A flag in the mud. My own flag was tattered, and the
mud was rising.</p>
<p>I turned north, away from the warehouse coffins, towards the one
place Dekker might not think to look for a rat on the run: the brighter,
harder streets near the Exchange. Where the men of business and property
kept their private rooms, their discreet clubs, their second lives. It
was a different kind of jungle, with different rules. I had a little
money left, not from Dekker’s job, but from before. It was the coin of a
different person. It would have to buy me a night in a cage of my own
choosing.</p>
<p>The final obstacle wasn’t a man with a knife. It was the city itself.
Every face a potential informant, every lighted window a possible eye.
The chase had become a slow, silent permeation. Dekker wasn’t just
pursuing me. He was becoming the very air I had to breathe. The vise
wasn’t closing from two sides. It was forming from all around, a
pressure building in the atmosphere itself.</p>
<p>I found a place on the Binnenweg, a boarding house run by a widow
with a face like a closed ledger. I paid for a week in advance, in cash.
The room was clean, bleak, and anonymous. It smelled of soap and dust. I
barred the door and stood at the window, looking down at the carriages
and the well-dressed men below. The silk district. I was back amidst the
texture of wealth, but now I was a burr caught in its hem, a thing that
did not belong.</p>
<p>The woman on the dock. Her interference was not an act of kindness.
It was an act of housekeeping. She had removed a nuisance from her
space. In this new game, that was the only form of alliance I could hope
for: the temporary convergence of disinterest.</p>
<p>I lay on the narrow bed, coat and boots still on, my knife on the
pillow beside me. The taste of copper was gone from my tongue, replaced
by the flat, stale aftertaste of canal water and dread. I had navigated
the last leg not with a clever trick, but with the brute-force
desperation of a cornered animal, and then by the random, dispassionate
intervention of a stranger. I had learned nothing elegant. Only that the
mud would always be there, waiting to suck at your heels, and the silk
was a target you now carried on your back.</p>
<p>Outside, the city hummed its night-time hymn of commerce and secrecy.
Somewhere in it, Dekker was listening to a report. Somewhere, a widow
touched a hidden fold of crimson. Somewhere, a woman collected mussels
from a dock, undisturbed.</p>
<p>And I, in a clean, quiet room I could not afford, waited for the
walls to prove themselves an illusion. The clarity was absolute. The
reward was a sentence. The wire was pulled taut, and I was the one now
vibrating upon it, waiting for the next pluck, the next note in a song I
had no choice but to dance to. The game was no longer on the board. The
game was the board. And every square was closing in.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-9-1"><strong>Chapter 9</strong></h2>
<p>The silence in the clean room became a thing you could wear, a
second, tighter skin. It pressed on the eardrums. I lay on the bed for
two days, or maybe three. Time was measured by the slant of grey light
on the floorboards, by the distant bells marking hours that meant
nothing, by the hollow, specific ache of hunger that I ignored until it
too became a kind of silence. The widow with the ledger-face left a tray
of bread and thin soup outside the door each evening. I waited for the
creak of her retreating step on the stairs before I retrieved it, ate
without tasting, placed the empty bowl back on the boards. This was not
healing. This was a tactical pause. A regrouping in a shallow trench
before the final, stupid push over the top.</p>
<p>The clarity I’d felt was a cold, sharp stone in my gut. The game was
the board. I was a piece that had been knocked into the mud, wiped
clean, and placed back on a different square. The rules had not changed.
Only the texture of the squares. Silk here. Stone there. Mud everywhere
beneath.</p>
<p>On the fourth morning, or the fifth, the silence broke. Not with a
sound, but with an absence. The tray from the night before was gone, but
no new one had been placed. The space outside my door was empty. A
different silence. I was already on my feet, knife in hand, back to the
wall beside the door. I listened to the house breathe. A floorboard
sighed somewhere below. The distant clatter of a pan. Normal sounds. Too
normal.</p>
<p>The message was elegant in its simplicity. The free ride was over.
The temporary convergence of disinterest had reached its terminus. I was
no longer a burr in the hem; I was a stain that needed scrubbing out.
The widow’s ledger had been balanced.</p>
<p>I packed nothing because I owned nothing. The coat, the boots, the
knife, the clothes on my back that had dried stiff with canal salt. I
had a little cash left, a few damp notes folded into a inner pocket. It
was enough for a meal, or a bullet, or five minutes of someone’s divided
attention. I opened the door. The hallway was empty, smelling of wax and
boiled cabbage. I went down the stairs like a shadow peeling itself from
a wall.</p>
<p>The widow was in the front parlour, her back to me, dusting a
porcelain shepherdess with a furious, precise concentration. She did not
turn. I did not speak. The transaction was complete. I stepped out onto
the Binnenweg.</p>
<p>The silk district in the morning was a performance of civility.
Carriages were polished to a liquid black. Shop windows displayed bolts
of cloth like frozen waterfalls. Men in dark coats moved with the
assured gait of those who owned the ground beneath their feet. I moved
through them, a discordant note. My coat was a map of my disgrace. My
face was a closed door. They parted around me, a stream around a stone,
their eyes sliding away with a practiced, effortless disdain. It was the
same look the men in De Visser had given me, just laundered and pressed.
The language of exclusion was universal; only the accent changed.</p>
<p>I needed a weapon that wasn’t steel. Information was a currency I
couldn’t afford. Leverage was a weight I couldn’t lift. All I had was
the one thing they had tried to drown, to silence, to bury in
ledger-books and polite aversion: my own inconvenient existence. A woman
out of place is a question. I had spent my life trying to erase the
question mark. Now, it was the only tool I had left.</p>
<p>I found a café with windows too clean, where the coffee cost more
than my room. I took a table in the corner, my back to the wall. I
ordered coffee. The waiter, a man with a spine so stiff it seemed to
protest his own servitude, brought it with a look that priced the china
cup higher than my life. I drank it slowly. I let myself be seen. A
feral thing in a gilded cage. Let Dekker’s men find me here. Let them
see I was not hiding. Let the wire vibrate.</p>
<p>They came, of course. But not the bruisers from the docks. These were
two men in well-cut but anonymous suits. They moved like accountants,
but their eyes were not for numbers. They sat without asking, one across
from me, one beside, blocking me in. The café did not notice. The
performance of civility continued around us, a soundproof bell jar.</p>
<p>“Mevrouw Visser,” said the one across from me. He had a pleasant
face, the kind you forget instantly. “You are difficult to account
for.”</p>
<p>I said nothing. I took another sip of coffee. The bitterness was a
comfort.</p>
<p>“Your uncle is concerned,” said the one beside me. His voice was
lower, a soft abrasion. “Your… departure from his care was abrupt. He
wishes to ensure your well-being.”</p>
<p>“I am well,” I said. My voice was rough from disuse. “You can tell
him his concern is noted.”</p>
<p>The pleasant man smiled. It didn’t touch his eyes. “He insists. We
have a carriage outside. A quiet reunion. For your own safety, of
course. The city is not kind to women alone.”</p>
<p>The old threat, dressed in new silk. The vise, politely offered. I
looked from one pleasant face to the other. They were not here to kill
me in this clean place. They were here to disappear me back into the
narrative Dekker had written: the unstable niece, the family burden,
safely sequestered. A private problem. A woman’s problem. Neatly
solved.</p>
<p>I placed the china cup down on its saucer. The click was very loud in
my ear. “No,” I said.</p>
<p>The word hung in the air between us, small and absurd. A pebble
against a fortress wall.</p>
<p>The pleasant man’s smile tightened. “I’m afraid it’s not a
request.”</p>
<p>“It is from me,” I said. I looked directly at him, held his gaze the
way I’d held the stares in De Visser. A show of teeth. “You will tell my
uncle I am no longer a member of his household. My debts to that fiction
are paid. In blood and water. He can balance his books without me.”</p>
<p>The man beside me shifted. I felt the pressure of his thigh against
mine under the table, a physical reminder of my containment. “You
misunderstand your position.”</p>
<p>“I understand it perfectly,” I said, my voice dropping to match his.
“I am the position. I am the inconvenient truth. You can try to remove
me. But you will have to do it here. In front of all these polite
witnesses.” I gestured slightly with my chin at the room. “How will you
explain it? A fit of female hysteria? A tragic accident with a coffee
cup? The story will get out. And silk is fragile. It stains so
easily.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. The pleasant man’s eyes flickered, just for an
instant, to the well-dressed women at a nearby table, to the shop owner
reading his newspaper by the window. The performance had a audience. I
was no longer a piece on Dekker’s board. I was a splinter shoved under
the fingernail of his public world.</p>
<p>“You have nothing,” the low-voiced man hissed.</p>
<p>“I have this chair,” I said. “I have this cup. And for the next few
minutes, I have your complete attention. That is a kind of power. Tell
Dekker the game has changed. The board is in the window. Everyone can
see the pieces now.”</p>
<p>I saw the calculation in their eyes. The risk assessment. I was a
cornered animal, yes. But cornered animals bite. And blood on silk is a
transaction that can never be undone.</p>
<p>The pleasant man stood up abruptly. He placed a coin on the table,
far too much for the coffee. “For your trouble,” he said, his voice
still cordial, but now edged with frost. “We will convey your…
sentiments.”</p>
<p>They left as they came, two ghosts in suits, absorbed back into the
stream of civility. I sat there until my coffee went cold. My hands were
steady. The stone of clarity in my gut had grown hotter, harder. It was
no longer just clarity. It was a coal.</p>
<hr />
<p>The sacrifice was not offered. It was demanded.</p>
<p>They found me that evening, not on the quiet Binnenweg, but in the
liminal space between the silk and the stone, a narrow alley where the
fashionable backs of buildings turned their shoulder to the older,
grimier streets. This time, they did not come with polite words. They
came with cudgels and the intent to break bones quietly, to make my
disappearance a back-alley footnote, a cautionary tale for no one.</p>
<p>There were three of them. Not accountants. These were the men from
the docks, the ones with the thick necks and the remembered grudge.
Dekker was done with subtlety. The message was clear: if I would not be
sequestered, I would be erased.</p>
<p>I fought. Not with elegance, but with the terrible, efficient rage of
someone who has nothing left to lose. I used the knife. I felt it bite
into meat, grate on bone. I used the brick wall, my boots, my teeth. It
was a ugly, grunting, wet affair. The smell of blood and gutter mud rose
around us, a familiar perfume. One man went down, clutching his thigh,
his scream choked off into a wet gurgle. Another caught my knife across
his forearm, cursing.</p>
<p>But the third was behind me. His arm locked around my throat, a bar
of iron. The cudgel in his other hand rose. This was it. Not a grand
defeat, but a sordid, anonymous end in the mud. The final square.</p>
<p>Then, a shadow detached itself from the deeper shadows of a
doorway.</p>
<p>It moved with a silence that was more than the absence of sound. It
was a vacuum. A shape, slight and hooded, crossed the two paces between
the doorway and the man with the cudgel. There was a flash of pale hand,
a twist, a sharp, dry crack like a branch snapping underfoot. The man’s
grip vanished. He fell, his head at an angle the body was not meant to
hold.</p>
<p>My other two assailants froze. The one bleeding from his arm stared,
his face a mask of superstitious dread. The thing in the hood turned
towards him. It made no move to advance. It simply stood, a hole cut in
the world.</p>
<p>They ran. They left their groaning companion in the mud and fled.</p>
<p>I leaned against the wall, gasping, the taste of blood and adrenaline
sharp in my mouth. I looked at my rescuer. The hood fell back, just a
little.</p>
<p>It was the woman from the dock. The mussel-gatherer. Her face was
calm, placid as a millpond. There was no exertion in her expression, no
anger, no pity. Her eyes, in the thin light from a high window, were the
colour of the canal at dusk.</p>
<p>“You,” I rasped.</p>
<p>She nodded once. She looked at the man at her feet, then at the one
still whimpering in the gutter. Her gaze was that of a gardener
considering two slugs among her lettuces.</p>
<p>“They will send more,” she said. Her voice was low, uninflected. “He
cannot allow the challenge to stand. You have moved from a nuisance to a
threat. He will spend capital to remove you.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I pushed myself upright, wiping my mouth with the back of my
hand. “Why this? First the dock, now this. What is your interest?”</p>
<p>She was silent for a long moment, her eyes on me, measuring. “You
stand in the way,” she said finally. “Not of him. Of the flow. You are a
rock in the stream. He is the dam. To remove the dam, the rock must
first be… repositioned.”</p>
<p>“I’m not your tool.”</p>
<p>“No,” she agreed. “You are your own. That is the point. But your path
and mine… converge. For a moment.” She stepped over the body at her feet
as if it were a sack of rubbish. She came closer. She smelled of cold
water and wet stone. “He has a ledger. Not of money. Of favours. Of
secrets. It is kept in his study, behind the portrait of his dead wife.
It is the true foundation of his power. The silk is just the
curtain.”</p>
<p>I stared at her. “You want me to steal it.”</p>
<p>“I want you to burn it,” she said. “To take the foundation from under
him. The men who owe him, the men who fear him… they will see the dam is
cracked. The water will do the rest.”</p>
<p>“And you? What do you get?”</p>
<p>“The stream flows,” she said simply. “My dock remains undisturbed. My
world is small. I keep it clean.” She reached into the folds of her dark
shawl and pulled out a small, flat key, tarnished black. She held it
out. “The service door to the garden. The lock was changed last month.
He does not know the smith owes me a favour.”</p>
<p>I looked at the key. It was an answer. It was a deeper trap. It was
the only move left on a board where every other square was poison.</p>
<p>“Why me?” My voice was a whisper. “You could do it. You could have
done it any time.”</p>
<p>She almost smiled. It was a fleeting, cold thing. “I am part of the
stream. I cannot act against the dam directly. It would… upset the
balance. But a rock, thrown by chance? A spark from a stray fire?” She
tilted her head. “You are already burning. I am just pointing you at the
right fuel.”</p>
<p>The sacrifice was not my life. That was being taken. The sacrifice
was my last, frayed claim to neutrality, to existing in the cracks. To
take the key was to choose a side. To become, willingly, the weapon. To
trade the last of my tattered self for the chance to tear his world
down.</p>
<p>I thought of the clean, quiet room. The ledger-faced widow. The
polite men in the café. The mud sucking at my heels. The taste of copper
and canal. The wire thrumming under my feet.</p>
<p>I took the key. It was cold, and it fit my palm as if it had been
moulded there.</p>
<p>The woman nodded. “The house will be empty tonight. He dines with the
burgomasters. A show of solidarity. The servants will be in the front,
preparing his triumphant return.” She looked at me one last time, her
gaze stripping me bare. “Be the spark.”</p>
<p>Then she was gone, melting back into the alley’s darkness, leaving me
with two bodies, a key, and a sentence I had just pronounced upon
myself.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Dekker house was a slab of arrogance in the moonlight, all gabled
roofs and leaded windows that stared like blind eyes. I approached from
the back, through the ordered, sleeping gardens. The key turned in the
new lock with a smooth, oiled click. The disloyal smith had done good
work.</p>
<p>Inside, the silence was a wealth of its own. It was a different
silence from my rented room—a thick, smug quiet, padded by carpets and
polished wood and inherited confidence. I moved through the servant’s
corridors, a ghost in a tomb. I knew this house. I had navigated it as a
ghost for years. But now I was not a spectral niece. I was a burglar. A
toxin in the blood.</p>
<p>The study door was locked. A heavier, older lock. I used the pick I’d
fashioned from a hairpin and a bit of filed-down spoon handle, tools of
a desperate woman. The mechanism yielded with a sigh. I slipped
inside.</p>
<p>The room smelled of him. Of cigar smoke, leather, and the faint,
cloying scent of the pomade he used. The moon through the tall window
lit the massive desk, the globe, the portrait of his wife—a pale, mild
woman who had died of nothing more specific than quiet despair. I went
to the portrait. My heart was a cold, hard drum in my chest. No panic.
Just a lethal focus.</p>
<p>The frame was heavy. I found the catch, a clever thing disguised as a
curl in the painted gilt. It released. The portrait swung outward on
silent hinges, revealing a wall safe, dark and metallic.</p>
<p>This was the lock the smith could not help with. This was Dekker’s
final confidence. A combination. Numbers of personal significance. I
stood before it, my mind utterly still. I was not a safecracker. I was
the rock. The spark.</p>
<p>I thought of the numbers that would matter to a man like him. Dates
of incorporation. Birthdays he pretended to remember. None felt true. He
was a man of transactions, not sentiment. His true sentiment was power.
Its acquisition. Its measure.</p>
<p>And then I knew.</p>
<p>I reached out and turned the dial. Not to a date, but to a sum. The
first major contract that had lifted him from merchant to magnate. The
number I’d heard him cite like a mantra, a foundational myth. I spun the
dial. The second, the profit from the first wartime shipment, the one
that had sealed his reputation. The third, the estimated yearly revenue
when he was named to the guild council.</p>
<p>The last number was not a sum. It was a year. The year his wife died.
The year all pretense of being anything other than a pure engine of
acquisition had fallen away.</p>
<p>The lock gave a solid, satisfying <em>clunk</em>.</p>
<p>I pulled the safe door open.</p>
<p>Inside were no jewels, no stacks of currency. There were documents.
Deeds. Bonds. And a single, large, leather-bound ledger, its cover worn
dark with handling. I lifted it out. It was heavier than it looked. I
carried it to the desk, set it down in the pool of moonlight.</p>
<p>I opened it.</p>
<p>It was not a financial ledger. Columns, yes. But the entries were
names. Dates. Brief, cryptic notations. <em>Van Hertz – canal vote –
resolved.</em> <em>De Wit – daughter’s situation – contained.</em>
<em>Officer L. – inspection waiver – gratitude extended.</em> Payments
were not in guilders, but in favours, in silences, in ruined competitors
and vanished obstacles. Here was the city’s power, not as a map, but as
a circulatory system, and Dekker was the heart. Every pulse of
influence, every suppressed scandal, every coerced vote was recorded
here in his neat, merciless hand.</p>
<p>This was the dam. The concrete and steel of his control.</p>
<p>From the desk, I took his silver cigar lighter. A beautiful, heavy
thing. I flicked the wheel. The flame sprang up, small and perfect and
hungry.</p>
<p>I did not hesitate. I did not read another entry. I held the flame to
the corner of the first page.</p>
<p>The paper was thick, expensive. It resisted for a heartbeat, then
blackened, curled, and caught. The fire ate greedily, its light dancing
up, illuminating the room in a new, blasphemous way. I fed it page after
page, tearing them out, crumpling them, watching names and secrets turn
to ash and heat. The smoke was acrid, sweet with the smell of burning
leather and lost power.</p>
<p>I burned it all. Every page. I stood over the growing pile of ash in
the cold fireplace, a priestess of a terrible sacrament. This was the
defeat. Not of a man, but of a system. I was not cutting off a head; I
was poisoning the well.</p>
<p>The last page curled into black lace. The fire began to die.</p>
<p>Then, a voice from the doorway.</p>
<p>“I should have known the rot would come from within the house.”</p>
<p>Dekker stood there, still in his evening coat, a crystal glass of
brandy in his hand. His face was not contorted with rage. It was pale,
stiff with a disbelief so profound it had frozen him. He looked from the
smouldering ashes in the hearth to me, my face lit by the dying
embers.</p>
<p>“You stupid creature,” he whispered, the words barely audible. “Do
you have any idea what you have done?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. My voice was steady, smoke-roughened. “I have balanced
your books.”</p>
<p>He moved then, not towards me, but to his desk, yanking open a
drawer. He pulled out a pistol, a sleek, deadly thing. He levelled it at
me. His hand did not shake. “For that, there is no currency. There is
only erasure.”</p>
<p>I did not flinch. I looked down the barrel, and I smiled. It was not
a subtle show of teeth. It was a full, wild baring of them. “Shoot me,
Uncle. Add it to the ledger. See if the ash remembers the entry.”</p>
<p>He hesitated. The pistol wavered, just a fraction. He was a man of
ledgers, of calculated risks. A shot here, now, in his study, with the
ashes of his power still warm… the story would be impossible to control.
The rock had not just been thrown; it had shattered the dam’s face.
Water was already leaking out. A flood of questions. A corpse would only
widen the breach.</p>
<p>The moment hung, suspended. The coal in my gut was a sun.</p>
<p>Then, from the hall, came the sound of raised voices. Anxious
servants. The front door bell ringing, insistently. The world was
knocking, and it had seen the smoke.</p>
<p>Dekker’s eyes darted to the door, then back to me. The calculation in
them was frantic, visible. The dam-keeper seeing the first fatal
crack.</p>
<p>“Get out,” he hissed, the word venomous. “Get out of my house. If I
ever see you again—”</p>
<p>“You won’t,” I said. I took a step towards him, not away. The pistol
tracked me. “You will be too busy. Trying to call in favours from ash.
Explaining to the men named in that book why you no longer have their
secrets. You built a world on silence, Uncle. Now listen to the
noise.”</p>
<p>I turned my back on him. On the pistol. I walked to the French doors
that led to the garden. I could feel the aim between my shoulder blades,
a cold, focused point of dread. I did not look back. I opened the door.
The cold night air washed over me, clean and sharp.</p>
<p>No shot came.</p>
<p>I stepped out into the garden, into the world of broken silence, and
I did not run. I walked. The wire was gone. I had not slipped from it. I
had sawed through it, and let the whole treacherous structure fall.</p>
<hr />
<p>I emerged not on the Binnenweg, not in the alley, not in any place I
knew. I walked until the silk gave way to stone, and the stone gave way
to the wooden wharves of a different canal, a commercial stretch where
the air smelled of tar and Baltic timber. The sky was lightening to a
dirty grey wool in the east.</p>
<p>I was not the same. The transformation was not a shedding, but an
accretion. I had worn the mud, the silk, the fear, the clarity. Now I
wore the ash. It was in the lines of my hands, the smell in my hair. I
was not reborn clean. I was forged dirty. The stray cat was gone. In its
place was something leaner, harder—a creature of deliberate tooth and
claw, who had looked into the heart of the machine and not blinked, who
had chosen to be the spark in the tinder.</p>
<p>The game was not over. Dekker was not dead. But his power was
crippled, bleeding out into the gutters of gossip and fear. The woman on
the dock had her clean flow. I had my fire.</p>
<p>I had no money. No place. The sentence of my existence was still upon
me. But it was a sentence I now carried in my own hand, not one read to
me from another’s ledger.</p>
<p>I found a public pump and worked the handle. Icy water gushed out. I
scrubbed my hands, my face, watching the soot and blood swirl away in
the runoff, staining the cobbles. I could not scrub out the smell of
smoke. I did not want to.</p>
<p>From the timber yard, a whistle blew. Men began to appear, shapes in
the dawn mist, heading for a day’s labour. I looked at them. I looked at
the water, at the city beginning to stir—a city with one less dam, with
a new, faint scent of burning on its air.</p>
<p>I had sacrificed my last claim to peace. I had chosen the greater
good of the chaos that would now consume my uncle over the lesser evil
of my own silent suffocation. I had defeated not a man, but the myth of
his invincibility. And I had emerged not as my true self, for I had no
idea what that was, but as my only self: the woman who burned the
books.</p>
<p>A figure detached itself from the gathering workers and walked
towards me. Not a dockworker. A woman in a sensible, dark dress, a
basket over her arm. She had a sharp, intelligent face, and her eyes
went directly to the lingering smudges on my skin, to the set of my
shoulders.</p>
<p>“You look like you’ve had a night of it,” she said, her voice frank,
assessing. No pity. No disdain.</p>
<p>I said nothing. I just watched her.</p>
<p>“They say there was a fire in the silk district last night,” she
continued, her gaze holding mine. “A small one. Contained to a study.
But the interesting thing is the stories that are <em>not</em> burning.
They’re spreading. Fast.”</p>
<p>I remained silent.</p>
<p>A faint smile touched her lips. “My name is Elara Vossen. I publish a
broadsheet. <em>The Lantern.</em>” She paused. “It seems I have a sudden
surplus of ink, and a deficit of reliable sources. And you… you look
like a woman who knows where the bodies are buried. And perhaps why they
were put there.”</p>
<p>She held out her hand. Not in help, but in proposition.</p>
<p>I looked at her hand. I looked at the city, waking to a new day, a
day with a crack in its foundation. The vibration was gone. In its place
was a hum, low and potential. The song was not over. It had just changed
key.</p>
<p>I took her hand. Her grip was firm, dry. A new transaction. A new
convergence.</p>
<p>“Buy me a coffee,” I said. “And I’ll tell you a story about a
ledger.”</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-10-1"><strong>Chapter 10</strong></h2>
<p>The dawn’s grey promise had curdled into a flat, indifferent morning
by the time I left Elara Vossen at the mouth of a printer’s alley. The
coffee she’d bought was a bitter, granular sludge, but the heat of it
had been a second handshake, sealing the contract. Her questions were
needles, probing for the seams in the story I’d given her—a sanitised
version, all numbers and negligence, no ghosts, no girls in attics.
She’d listened, her sharp face a mask of polite scepticism, and I knew
the ledger was only an entry fee. She wanted the currency beneath it.
She’d get it, in time. When it suited me.</p>
<p>My feet carried me not to the rented room above the chandler’s, but
to the canal house. It was a compulsion, a morbid curiosity. To see the
cage empty.</p>
<p>The city did feel different. The air, still holding the damp chill of
the night’s rain, no longer vibrated with that sub-audible threat.
Instead, it buzzed with a new frequency: the chatter of a maid shaking a
rug from a window, the clatter of a cart over cobbles, a snatch of song
from a barge. Ordinary sounds. But they felt newly minted, fragile. The
scent of burning was gone, scrubbed away by the damp, or simply absorbed
into the city’s older, deeper smells of wet stone and rotting wood.</p>
<p>I turned onto my uncle’s street. The house stood as it always had, a
stern, narrow face of brick and white trim. But the myth of its
impenetrability was gone. I saw the cracks in the pointing, the slight
warp of the front door where the damp got in. I saw it as a structure,
not a fortress. A curtain twitched in the parlour window of the house
opposite. Mrs. De Wit, no doubt, hungry for the spectacle of disgrace. I
gave her my back, a flat denial of her theatre.</p>
<p>The front door was unlocked.</p>
<p>I pushed it open. The hallway was a tomb of polished silence. No
Gerrit looming from the shadows, no scent of starch and disapproval. The
only smell was lemon oil and, faintly beneath it, the ghost of last
night’s smoke, trapped in the fibres of the rug. I stood on the
threshold, my boots leaving gritty halos on the waxed floor. A
trespasser in a museum of my own making.</p>
<p>“Anika?”</p>
<p>The voice came from the morning room, thin and frayed. Aunt Marit. I
followed the sound.</p>
<p>She was sitting in her usual chair by the cold hearth, a shawl tight
around her shoulders despite the room’s stuffy warmth. Her hands were
clasped in her lap, but they were not still; they worried at each other,
a frantic, silent dance. Her face, when she looked up at me, was the
colour of old paper. The change in her was not the profound shift I
carried; it was a collapse. The careful architecture of her obedience
had lost its central pillar, and the whole structure was subsiding into
dust.</p>
<p>“They took him,” she said. Her voice was a dry leaf. “Two men from
the burgemeester’s office. Just after first light. He went quietly. He…
he looked at me. He didn’t say a word.”</p>
<p>I said nothing. I took off my coat, the one that smelled of damp and
fryer grease, and draped it over the back of a Hepplewhite chair. The
act itself was a violation. She flinched as if I’d shouted.</p>
<p>“Did you know?” she asked, and the question wasn’t an accusation. It
was a plea for a map, for any landmark in this sudden, terrifying
terrain.</p>
<p>“I suspected,” I said. My voice sounded foreign in this room, too
clear, too grounded. “The ledger. The contracts. They were…
inventive.”</p>
<p>Her eyes searched my face, not for lies, but for a reflection of her
own terror. She found none. “They said fraud. Misuse of civic funds.
They said the investigation would be… extensive.” Her hands twisted.
“What will become of us?”</p>
<p>The ‘us’ was the house, the silver, the reputation. The carefully
curated performance of respectability. It was the only world she knew
how to value.</p>
<p>“You’ll survive,” I said, and it came out colder than I intended. I
walked to the sideboard, poured a glass of water from the crystal
pitcher. I drank it standing. Another violation. “The money he hid will
be found. Some of it, anyway. It will be enough. You are not
implicated.”</p>
<p>“Not implicated?” A spark of her old spirit, fanned by fear. “I am
his wife. My name is his name. My shame is his shame.” She looked at me,
truly looked, and her eyes widened. “Your hands.”</p>
<p>I glanced down. The smudges of soot were still there, ground into the
cuticles, the lines of the palms. The woman’s frank assessment had noted
them. My aunt saw them and saw the end of the world.</p>
<p>“There was a fire,” I said, placing the glass down on a polished
surface without a coaster. “In the silk district. I heard.”</p>
<p>“You’re different,” she whispered. The fear in her eyes curdled into
something else—a kind of horrified recognition. “You’re not… you’re not
<em>grieving</em>.”</p>
<p>I almost laughed. The sound stuck in my throat. “What would you have
me grieve, Aunt? The loss of a tyrant? The end of the allowance he doled
out like a jailer’s rations?” I took a step towards her. She shrank
back. “He kept me small. He kept you small. He traded on our silence.
That trade is over.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, a frantic, bird-like motion. “You don’t
understand. You’ve made it worse. A man can be a thief, and a wife can
mourn a thief. But a man who is brought low by… by <em>this</em>…” Her
gesture took in my soot-stained hands, my posture, the entire
unacceptable fact of me. “The whispers will be cruel. They will say he
couldn’t control his own household. That the weakness was in his blood.
They will say <em>we</em> did this.”</p>
<p>For the first time, I saw the true prison. It wasn’t the house, or
the ledger. It was the story. The one where a man’s failure was a
private tragedy, but a woman’s rebellion was a public contagion. My
uncle’s crime was a masculine failing—greed, overreach. The consequence
was a legal process, a civic matter. But my action, my match struck in
the dark, was a feminine chaos. It broke a deeper law. I had not just
exposed his fraud; I had exposed the fraud of his authority, and by
extension, the brittle authority of every man in every house on this
street. The scandal would not be his greed, but his inability to smother
my spark.</p>
<p>I had not just burned a ledger. I had burned the script.</p>
<p>“Let them whisper,” I said, my voice low. “Their whispers are just
air. They kept you in this chair for twenty years. Are you really so
afraid to be without them?”</p>
<p>She stared at me as if I were speaking a savage tongue. The gulf
between us was no longer one of generation or temperament. It was
ontological. She was a creature of the old world, where survival was a
negotiation for smaller chains. I had stepped outside and breathed the
raw, chaotic air of freedom. There was no common language.</p>
<p>A noise from the hall—a hesitant shuffle. Liesbeth stood in the
doorway, her apron crisp, her face a careful blank. But her eyes, those
old, knowing eyes, went from my aunt’s crumpled form to my soot-stained,
standing figure. A verdict passed in that glance.</p>
<p>“Mevrouw,” she said, her voice dutifully flat. “The kitchen boy is
here. He is… agitated. He asks for the jongedame.”</p>
<p>My aunt waved a limp hand, dismissing a universe she could no longer
comprehend. I turned and followed Liesbeth out.</p>
<p>In the stark, tiled light of the kitchen, Piet stood shifting from
foot to foot. He saw me and his face collapsed with relief. “Miss Anika.
You’re here.”</p>
<p>“What is it, Piet?”</p>
<p>“It’s Mevrouw de Keizer. And the others. They’ve… they’ve heard.
About the master. They’re at the workshop. They’re asking for you.”</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The workshop, when I pushed open the door, was not silent. It
hummed.</p>
<p>The looms were still. No shuttles flew, no pedals thumped. But the
space was full of women. They stood in small groups, not in their usual
work rows, but in a loose circle. Clara de Keizer was at the centre, her
arms folded over her broad chest. There were girls from the finishing
room, their hands usually busy with needles now hanging empty at their
sides. Even old Maartje from the dye vats was there, her arms stained a
permanent, mottled blue.</p>
<p>The conversation died as I entered. All faces turned to me. It was
not the suspicious, sliding glance of the men in De Visser. This was a
direct, collective gaze, heavy with expectation and a nervous energy.
They were waiting. Not for a man to tell them what to do, but for a
sign. For a story.</p>
<p>Clara broke the silence. “They took him, then.”</p>
<p>“They did,” I confirmed, closing the door behind me. The click of the
latch was loud in the quiet.</p>
<p>A murmur rippled through them. It wasn’t jubilant. It was the sound
of an earthquake felt at a distance—a tremor of unstable ground.</p>
<p>“The orders,” said a young finisher named Griet. Her voice was thin
with anxiety. “We have the Van Houten shipment half-woven. The thread is
paid for, but the master’s seal… without it…”</p>
<p>“The wages,” said another. “Friday is pay-day. Who holds the purse
now?”</p>
<p>They looked at me. The questions were practical, immediate, born of a
lifetime of precarity. Their world had been upended, and their first
instinct was to find the new walls, to learn the new rules of the cage.
The cage was all they had ever known.</p>
<p>I walked to the front of the room, near the silent master’s desk. I
did not sit behind it. I leaned against its edge, facing them. I felt
the grit of the city still on my skin, the phantom heat of the coffee
cup, the firm, dry grip of Elara Vossen’s hand. I had the elixir. It was
not gold, or a guarantee. It was a simpler, more terrifying thing: the
truth.</p>
<p>“The purse is empty,” I said. The words fell like stones. A few women
gasped. “Or it will be, once the burgemeester’s men are done. What
wasn’t stolen is frozen. The Van Houten order? The contract is void.
Fraudulently obtained.”</p>
<p>The anxiety curdled into panic. I saw it in the tightening of
shoulders, the darting eyes. Clara’s face remained stony, but her
knuckles were white where she gripped her own arms.</p>
<p>“Then we are ruined,” Griet whispered, a statement of fact.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. The word cut through the rising dread. “You are
unemployed. There is a difference.”</p>
<p>They stared, uncomprehending.</p>
<p>I pushed off from the desk. “My uncle’s wealth was a fiction. A theft
spread over columns and receipts. This business was a shell he used to
launder his reputation and his greed. The work you did here was real.
The skill in your hands is real. That is what remains. That is what
cannot be seized.”</p>
<p>“Skill doesn’t feed children,” Maartje croaked from the back, her
blue-stained hands held out, palms up. A gesture of empty utility.</p>
<p>“Not alone,” I agreed. I reached into the pocket of my dress—not the
fine wool of my aunt’s world, but my own sturdy, worn cotton—and pulled
out the small, leather-bound notebook Elara had given me. A journalist’s
tool. “But it is a place to start. Clara.”</p>
<p>Clara’s eyes narrowed. “Ja?”</p>
<p>“You have run this floor for ten years. You know every order, every
client, every thumb’s-width of tolerance on these looms. Could you run
it? Not as a foreman for a phantom, but for yourselves?”</p>
<p>The silence this time was absolute. The concept was so alien it took
a moment to parse.</p>
<p>“Ourselves?” Clara echoed.</p>
<p>“A cooperative,” I said, giving shape to the idea that had been
forming in the acid-bath of my mind since I left the printer’s alley.
“No master. No hidden ledger. The women of this workshop own the
workshop. You share the costs, you share the profits. You find the
clients—the real ones, the honest merchants my uncle bypassed for his
larger schemes. You work for each other.”</p>
<p>I was not sharing wealth. I was sharing agency. It was a more radical
currency.</p>
<p>“It is impossible,” said Griet, but her voice lacked conviction. It
was a reflex, the old world protesting.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked, genuinely curious. “Because it has never been done?
My uncle’s schemes were ‘impossible’ too, until he did them. The only
difference is the direction of the flow.” I looked at their faces, saw
the first flickers of something besides fear: calculation. Imagination.
“The building is leased. The lease is in his name, but with him
arrested, the landlord will want a tenant. Or a buyer. The looms are
here. The hands are here.”</p>
<p>Clara unfolded her arms. She took a step forward, her gaze sweeping
over the silent machinery, then over the faces of the women. “The Van
Houten thread,” she said slowly. “We own that, if the contract is void.
We could finish it. Sell it direct. Split the proceeds.”</p>
<p>“We’d need a buyer,” someone said.</p>
<p>“I know a buyer,” said another voice, hesitant. It was Liesbeth, who
had followed me and stood now in the doorway to the hall. She didn’t
enter, but her voice carried. “A chandler on the east canal. Honest. His
wife was a weaver. He’d treat with us.”</p>
<p>A spark, jumping a gap.</p>
<p>Then Maartje spoke up, her rasp cutting through. “The dye. The
master—<em>he</em>—always bought the cheap madder. It fades. I know a
source for true kermes. Costs more, but the colour lasts. It would set
our work apart.”</p>
<p><em>Our work.</em> The words hung in the air, luminous.</p>
<p>I did not lead them. I did not command. I had simply handed them the
key and pointed out that the door was not locked, only heavy. Now, they
were putting their shoulders to it.</p>
<p>The hum in the room changed pitch. It was no longer the hum of
anxiety, but of low, fervent conversation. Questions flew—legal,
practical, financial. They were questions they had never been allowed to
ask before. Clara began to marshal them, her voice taking on a new,
crisp authority. “Griet, you have a head for numbers. You and Liesbeth
will inventory the thread, the finished goods. Maartje, you will come
with me to see this chandler. We will need a proposal.”</p>
<p>I watched the new world being woven, not from silk, but from
necessity and a sudden, fierce solidarity. The script was being
rewritten, line by line, in the language of shared survival. I had given
them the spark. They were building the hearth.</p>
<p>As the planning gained a chaotic momentum, Clara broke away and came
to me. She stood close, her voice for me alone. “This is a dangerous
gift you give.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a gift,” I said. “It’s a return. It was always yours. He
just kept the receipt.”</p>
<p>She studied my face, seeing the soot, the shadows, the new,
unyielding light in my eyes. “And you? What do you get from this…
convergence?”</p>
<p>I thought of Elara Vossen’s proposition, of the ledger as just a
beginning. “I get a story that needs telling. And a city that needs to
hear it.”</p>
<p>She gave a slow, grim nod. A transaction understood. “Then we will
hold this end. You hold yours.” She offered her hand. It was broad,
calloused, strong from years of guiding fragile thread under tremendous
tension. I took it. Her grip was like a vice, but it did not seek to
dominate. It was a test of tensile strength. I met it, and after a
moment, the ghost of a smile touched her lips. “The woman who burned the
books,” she murmured, repeating the phrase that had begun as my private
epitaph and was now becoming a title. “See that you don’t get burned
yourself.”</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I did not return to the canal house. I walked, my path aimless yet
deliberate, a needle drawing a new thread through the old fabric of the
city. I ended up, as I suppose I knew I would, outside the chandler’s
where I rented my room. The ordinary world.</p>
<p>But it was not the same. The window of my room, high under the eaves,
looked down on me like the eye of a stranger. The climb up the narrow,
reeking stairs felt like entering a museum diorama of a life I had
outgrown. The room itself—the narrow bed, the washstand, the single
shelf with its few, practical books—was a shell. The creature that had
inhabited it had molted.</p>
<p>I lit the single lamp. The glow was weak against the afternoon gloom.
I went to the washstand, poured water from the jug into the basin. I
took the sliver of soap and began to scrub my hands. The water turned
grey, then black. The soot of the fire, the grime of the timber yard,
the psychic residue of the ledger—it swirled in the basin, a tangible
record of the night. I scrubbed until my skin was raw and pink, but I
knew some stains were permanent. They were not on the skin, but in it. A
tattoo of consequence.</p>
<p>This was the new ordinary. Not peace, but a precarious, humming
potential. Not a home, but a temporary base of operations. Not an
identity, but a purpose. I was the woman who burned the books. I was the
source for <em>The Lantern</em>. I was the silent partner in a weaver’s
cooperative. I was my aunt’s shame and my own salvation.</p>
<p>I dried my hands. The knock on the door, when it came, was not
tentative. It was a firm, rhythmic tap—official, impatient.</p>
<p>I did not startle. I had been waiting for the other shoe to drop. The
city’s new hum had a discordant note in it, and this was it.</p>
<p>I opened the door.</p>
<p>Two men stood on the landing. Not burgemeester’s clerks. These were
different. Older, with the weary, implacable eyes of men who have seen
every variety of human deceit. They wore dark, unadorned coats. One held
a leather-bound folder.</p>
<p>“Anika Visser?” the one with the folder said.</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“I am Inspector Bakker. This is Sergeant Hoorn. We are with the
Municipal Guard, Special Investigations.” His eyes moved past me, taking
in the poverty of the room in one swift, dismissive glance. “We have
some questions regarding the fire last night in the property of Mijnheer
Hendrik Visser. You will accompany us, please.”</p>
<p>It was not a request. The sergeant’s bulk subtly shifted, blocking
the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>The shift was not in their arrival, but in their focus. The fraud
investigation was one stream. This was another. They were not here about
stolen guilders. They were here about a fire. About a violation of
property, of order. A masculine domain had been breached by flame, and
the guardians of that order had come, as they always did, for the most
likely source of chaos. For the woman with soot on her hands.</p>
<p>I looked at the inspector’s impassive face. I looked at the
sergeant’s blocked path. The hook was not a mystery; it was a mechanism,
clicking into place. The story was spreading, and now the city’s immune
system was reacting. I had chosen the greater good of chaos. Now it was
time to see how deep the current ran, and if I could swim in it.</p>
<p>I reached for my coat, still damp, still smelling of the world
outside. “Of course,” I said, my voice calm, a flat surface over deep,
dark water. “But you’ll have to make it quick. I have an appointment
with a journalist.”</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-11-1"><strong>Chapter 11</strong></h2>
<p>The city’s hum had changed key. It was no longer a drone of resigned
misery, but a low, complex chord—the grumble of machinery, the distant
shout of a foreman, the rhythmic scrape of shovels clearing the last of
the charred timbers from the Visser yard. It was a song of work, of
salvage. I walked through it now not as a ghost, but as a current within
it. The rain, when it came, was vertical. It fell with a purpose, to
clean, not to punish. It beaded on the oilcloth of my new coat—a
practical, dark-green thing bought with the first of my consulting
fees—and ran off in clean rivulets.</p>
<p>My room was no longer a cell. It was an office. The narrow table was
stacked with ledgers not my own, with schematics for ventilation
systems, with proposed amendments to the municipal code on factory
safety. The smell of damp wool and fryer grease had been replaced by the
scent of strong coffee, ink, and the faint, metallic trace of type from
the proofs Pieter van Houten had begun sending me. The space was still
small, still poor, but it had been weaponized. It had intention.</p>
<p>I shrugged off the coat, hanging it on the peg behind the door. From
the pocket, I withdrew a single, cream-colored envelope. The paper was
thick, expensive. It bore no return address, only my name, written in a
sharp, angular hand. I set it on the table, unopened. It could wait.
Invitations from the Burgemeester’s newly-formed Industrial Liaison
Committee could always wait. They needed the specter of the Visser fire,
the living, breathing reminder of what neglect cost. I was their
conscience, hired and housed. A useful woman. The irony was a coal I
kept warm in my palm.</p>
<p>The knock on my door was not the firm, official rap of the Municipal
Guard. It was a quick, syncopated rhythm—one-two, one-two-three. I
smiled, a private, genuine thing.</p>
<p>“It’s open, Lena.”</p>
<p>The door swung inward, bringing with it a gust of the canal’s damp
air and the vibrant presence of Lena de Wit. She no longer wore the
drab, shapeless dress of a Visser floor-girl. Her clothes were still
simple—a sturdy skirt, a clean blouse—but they fit. A leather tool-belt
was slung low on her hips, a holster for wrenches and calipers. Her
hands, scrubbed but permanently etched with the memory of grease, held a
paper-wrapped bundle.</p>
<p>“Brought you something,” she said, her voice louder, clearer than it
had ever been in the factory’s roar. She tossed the bundle onto the
table. It landed with a solid <em>thunk</em>. “From the lads. Well, from
Kees, mainly. He’s taken over the smithy on Zoutsteeg, you know. Proper
partnership.”</p>
<p>I unwrapped the paper. Inside was a metal flask, hammered steel,
simple and flawless. It was cool and heavy in my hand. Engraved on the
side, in clean, unadorned letters, was a single word: <em>Vuur</em>.
Fire.</p>
<p>“It’s for your coffee,” Lena said, dropping into the room’s other
chair without being asked. “Kees said a consultant shouldn’t be drinking
from chipped mugs. Gives the wrong impression.”</p>
<p>I ran my thumb over the engraving. A show of teeth, however subtle.
“It’s perfect. Tell him thank you.”</p>
<p>“I will.” She leaned back, surveying the room with a foreman’s eye.
“Busy.”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot to do. The new regulations are just words on paper.
They have to be forced into the world. Like teeth into flesh.”</p>
<p>Lena nodded. She understood force. “We’re starting the inspections at
Van Leyden’s mill next week. The owner’s spitting nails, says we’ll
bankrupt him with our ‘womanly nerves.’” She grinned, a flash of white
in her weathered face. “I told him my nerves are just fine. It’s his
drive-belts I’m worried about. They’re frayed enough to make a saint
swear.”</p>
<p>This was the new current. Lena worked for the fledgling Worker’s
Safety Guild, a body born from the ashes and the public outcry that
followed. Pieter’s articles had done their work, painting not a portrait
of a tragic accident, but of a calculated neglect. The public, for a
moment, had cared. And in that moment, we had built a lever. Lena was
the lever’s point, applying pressure where it hurt.</p>
<p>“How’s your mother?” I asked.</p>
<p>Lena’s smile softened, just at the edges. “Better. The cough’s almost
gone. The doctor you sent… he actually listened.” She looked at me, the
easy bravado fading into something more complex. “She asks after you.
Calls you ‘that sharp angel.’ Thinks you’re too thin.”</p>
<p>“I am too thin,” I said, pouring coffee from the pot on the small
stove into the new flask. The metal hissed softly. “It’s a professional
asset. Makes me look hungry. Which I am.”</p>
<p>We drank in comfortable silence. The camaraderie was a new, strange
fabric. It was not friendship, not exactly. It was the mutual
recognition of soldiers who had survived the same trench. We had seen
the machinery from the inside, felt its teeth. Now we were outside,
trying to jam a spar into its gears. It was enough.</p>
<p>After Lena left, the flask of warm coffee in my hand, I went out. The
appointment with the journalist was long past; Pieter was more of a
colleague now, a co-conspirator in the daylight. This was a different
sort of patrol.</p>
<p>I walked east, towards the canals where the dye-works and smaller
machine shops clustered. The air here was still thick with the smell of
chemicals and hot metal, but the frantic, desperate pace had eased. Or
perhaps I was seeing it with new eyes. I paused outside a three-story
brick building, its windows newly cleaned, a fresh downspout gleaming
against the soot-stained wall.</p>
<p>A man emerged, rolling a handcart loaded with finished brass
fittings. He saw me, paused, and touched his cap. Not a gesture of
submission, but of recognition.</p>
<p>“Mevrouw Visser.”</p>
<p>“Mijnheer Bakker,” I nodded. This was not the Inspector. This was a
different Bakker, a foreman at the very works Hendrik had cited as
“unrealistic” for installing a fire-suppression pump. The city had
shamed him into it after the articles ran. A small victory.</p>
<p>“Pump’s in and tested,” he said, jerking a thumb back towards the
building. “Cost a bleeding fortune. But the men… they sleep better. The
wife nags less.” He said it with a grudging respect. The cost was
measured in guilders, but the value was in the quieting of a specific,
nightly fear. A masculine worry, so often dismissed as feminine nerves,
now validated by hardware and law.</p>
<p>“Good,” I said, and meant it.</p>
<p>I walked on. At a corner pub, the kind Hendrik might have frequented,
I saw a group of workers at a table. They were not slumped in exhausted
silence. They were leaning over a broadsheet, one of Pieter’s, arguing.
I caught the words “ventilation” and “mandatory.” Their disagreement was
not about <em>if</em> things should change, but <em>how</em>. The seed
of the idea had taken root. It was no longer my lonely obsession; it was
a collective problem to be solved. The chaos I’d chosen had crystallized
into a new, fragile order.</p>
<p>The light was fading, bleeding from grey to indigo, when I found
myself at the iron bridge overlooking the North Canal. This was where
I’d stood that first night, smelling of smoke and failure, the city a
cold, indifferent monster. I leaned on the railing, the hammered flask
cool through my gloves.</p>
<p>Below, a barge moved slowly, loaded with timber. A man on deck called
out to a woman on the tow-path, his voice carrying clear on the still
air. A mundane, human sound. The water reflected the newly-lit gas lamps
along the quay, not as a shattered mess, but as long, steady pillars of
light.</p>
<p>I thought of the girl in the damp coat, pushing into De Visser’s, all
show and no substance. A stray cat. She had been driven by a singular,
private hurt: an aunt’s shame, a stolen legacy. She had wanted to claim
a thing, a building, a name.</p>
<p>I had claimed nothing. And everything.</p>
<p>I had not gotten my inheritance. I had burned it to the ground. In
its place, I had built a reputation. It was a colder, harder currency
than brick and mortar. It was a tool. Anika Visser, the fire-woman. The
consultant. The sharp angel. A useful woman.</p>
<p>The hook the inspectors had tried to set in me had been swallowed,
digested, and the line turned back on the fisherman. The fraud
investigation had quietly dissolved, lost in the larger scandal of
Hendrik’s negligence. The official report on the fire concluded “faulty
wiring,” a polite fiction all parties now upheld. I had met their
mechanism with a greater one: the mechanism of public shame, of
financial pressure, of cold, hard legal code. It was a man’s game,
played with a woman’s weapons—observation, patience, the ruthless
exploitation of sentiment.</p>
<p>I was not saved. Salvation implied an end, a resting place. This was
a perpetual motion. The soot was gone from my hands, but it was etched
under the skin, a permanent blueprint. The world was still made of greed
and grinding gears, but I had learned the rhythm of the grind. I could
place my words, my very presence, like a grain of sand in the right
bearing, and listen for the satisfying shriek of friction.</p>
<p>From my pocket, I finally took the cream-colored envelope. I slit it
open with my thumbnail. The note inside was brief.</p>
<p><em>Mevrouw Visser,</em> <em>Your presence is requested at a private
dinner, to discuss the future oversight of the new safety ordinances.
The Burgemeester believes a more… integrated approach is warranted. Your
unique perspective would be invaluable.</em> <em>Friday, eight o’clock.
The House on the Herengracht.</em> <em>S. van der Linde.</em></p>
<p>Van der Linde. The Burgemeester’s chief fixer. A man who operated in
velvet-lined rooms, who turned progress into policy, and policy into
patronage. The invitation was not to a battle, but to a negotiation.
They wanted to bring the sharp angel inside, to perch her on a gilded
shelf. To integrate the chaos into the system, to blunt its teeth.</p>
<p>I looked from the note to the dark water, to the pillars of reflected
light. They wanted to give me a seat at the table. A place where the
rules were spoken, not broken. Where influence was a subtle poison in a
crystal glass.</p>
<p>A smile touched my lips, thin and without warmth. The girl from
Chapter 1 would have been cowed by the paper, intimidated by the
address. She would have seen it as an end.</p>
<p>I saw it for what it was: a new kind of door. And I knew, with a cold
certainty, that I would walk through it. Not to be integrated. But to
learn the new rules, so I could break them better.</p>
<p>I folded the note, tucked it back into its expensive envelope. The
hook was always there, in different metal, different bait. The current
never stopped. You simply learned to swim upstream.</p>
<p>Turning from the canal, I pulled my collar up against the evening
chill. The city’s hum deepened with the twilight, a contented,
productive purr. I walked into it, the weight of the steel flask a
comfortable anchor against my hip. I had an appointment to keep. A table
to set. And a new, more dangerous game to learn.</p>
<p>The House on the Herengracht would be warm, no doubt. Dry. Full of
polished men with reasoned voices. I wondered what they would smell
like, these men who shaped the world from upholstered chairs. I wondered
if they would flinch when I walked in, smelling of coffee, cold water,
and the faint, indelible scent of smoke.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h1>
<h2 id="final-chapter"><strong>Final Chapter</strong></h2>
<p>The rain was a soft, persistent whisper against the glass, a gentle
argument with the city’s old stones. It beaded on the window of the
corner office, distorting the view of the Herengracht’s stately,
rain-slicked facades into something liquid and dreamlike. Inside, the
air was still, holding the scent of beeswax, old paper, and the faint,
expensive ghost of Sandalwood from the man sitting across from me.</p>
<p>Simon van der Linde steepled his fingers, a gesture meant to convey
thoughtful authority. His suit was the grey of a dove’s breast, his
smile a practiced curve. “You see, the proposal is not about
containment. It’s about… channeling. Directing that formidable energy of
yours into structures that can sustain it, and amplify it. The
Burgemeester envisions a civic oversight role, a liaison between the
port authorities and the new community safety initiatives. A voice for
the practical realities.”</p>
<p>I let the silence stretch, watching the rain trace paths down the
pane. A year ago, in <em>De Visser</em>, silence from a man like this
would have been a wall I felt compelled to fill with my own voice, to
justify, to explain. Now, I understood it was a tool. Theirs, and
mine.</p>
<p>“A voice,” I repeated, my tone flat. “From a seat at a very long
table, I imagine. Where the practical realities get translated into
sub-committee reports.”</p>
<p>Van der Linde’s smile didn’t falter, but it cooled a degree.
“Progress requires procedure, my dear. The alternative is anarchy. Or,”
he paused, letting the alternative hang, “a continued existence on the
periphery, where one’s victories are necessarily… messy. And
temporary.”</p>
<p><em>My dear.</em> The needle, now sheathed in velvet. I thought of
the fryer-grease smell of my old coat, the guttural murmur of <em>De
Visser</em> falling silent as I entered. The periphery. That’s where
they’d always wanted me, where women like me belonged: outside, looking
in, or inside only on suffrance, a curiosity. The choice he offered was
a classic one: step inside, be legitimized, be neutered. Or stay
outside, be powerful in bursts, be alone.</p>
<p>I rose from the leather chair and walked to the window. The canal
below was a black mirror, holding the golden coins of streetlamps. A
barge slid past, silent. “You’re right,” I said, my back to him. “The
fire at the <em>Westindische</em> warehouse was messy. Exposing the
smuggling ring in the customs house was messy. Stopping the Kinderdijk
land-grab was exceptionally messy. For your friends.”</p>
<p>I turned. He was watching me, the polished mask still in place, but
his eyes were calculating, re-assessing the equation in the room. I was
no longer the sharp, ragged creature pulled from the water, grateful for
a towel. I was the woman who had drained that water, poisoned the well
for his associates, and now stood, dry and deliberate, in his
sanctum.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in a voice at your table, Meneer van der Linde,”
I said, my voice calm in the hushed room. “I’m interested in the
ledger.”</p>
<p>A flicker. A tiny crack. “The ledger?”</p>
<p>“The one that doesn’t appear in the sub-committee reports. The one
that shows who really owns the derelict properties slated for ‘urban
renewal,’ who profits from the safety inspections they delay, which
cousins get the tender for the new dike works.” I took a step toward the
desk. “The practical reality is that your system runs on two engines:
the public one you talk about, and the private one you don’t. I don’t
want to lubricate the public one. I want the schematics for the private
one.”</p>
<p>He laughed then, a dry, papery sound. “You are proposing
blackmail.”</p>
<p>“I am proposing a new understanding,” I corrected. “I don’t take a
seat. I become a… consultant. Unlisted. My work continues. But now,
instead of breaking your windows to get your attention, I use the back
door. And in return, certain windows remain unbroken. Certain ledgers
remain private.”</p>
<p>The gender of it was not lost on either of us. He offered the public,
masculine sphere: a title, a procedure, a visible but impotent place. I
demanded the private, the hidden, the realm of influence and whispered
deals—traditionally also a masculine preserve, but one accessed through
manipulation, through the informal power they always assumed women
wielded in shadows. I was claiming it outright, as a seat of power, not
a back alley.</p>
<p>He leaned back, the chair creaking softly. “And if we refuse this…
understanding?”</p>
<p>I allowed my own smile, the thin, warmthless one I’d felt on the
canal side weeks ago. I reached into the inner pocket of my jacket—not
the old wool coat, but a tailored piece of dark tweed—and pulled out a
single sheet of paper. I placed it on the immaculate blotter before him.
It was a copy of a shipping manifest, a list of container numbers. At
the bottom, in my handwriting, was a single name: the Burgemeester’s
brother-in-law.</p>
<p>“Then the next mess will require more than a procedural review to
clean up,” I said softly. “It will require a new election.”</p>
<p>He looked at the paper, then up at me. The calculation in his eyes
was gone, replaced by a cold, clear recognition. He saw not a woman to
be managed, but a force to be reckoned with. A counterpart.</p>
<p>“Friday, eight o’clock,” he said finally, his voice devoid of its
earlier paternal cadence. It was flat, professional. “There is a dining
club. De Zilveren Egel. We will discuss the parameters of your
consultancy.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “I’ll bring my own pen.”</p>
<p>I didn’t wait for a dismissal. I turned and walked out of the office,
past the silent, curious secretary, and into the carpeted hall. The
warmth of the building was climate-controlled, scentless, a different
kind of physical blow than <em>De Visser’s</em> had been. It was the
warmth of preserved power, of decisions made far from the rain.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The rain had settled into a drizzle as I walked. I didn’t head for
the tram or call a cab. I walked east, leaving the symmetrical grace of
the Herengracht for the tighter, darker arteries of the old port
district. The smells changed gradually: less wax and perfume, more wet
stone, diesel, and the ripe, living smell of the river.</p>
<p>I found myself outside <em>De Visser</em>. The neon sign buzzed,
flickering slightly, painting the wet cobbles a sickly orange. I pushed
the door open.</p>
<p>The warmth inside was a familiar embrace, thick with the smell of
stale beer, brine, and the honest sweat of a day’s labor. The
conversation—a low, guttural murmur—did not lull. A few heads turned,
but the glances were different now. There was no curiosity, no
challenge. A man at the bar—Pieter, who worked the winches on the
<em>Komet</em>—gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod. Another, at a
corner table, raised his glass a half-inch before returning to his
conversation.</p>
<p>I was no longer a woman out of place. I was a feature of the
landscape. The woman who had broken the <em>Westindische</em> syndicate.
The one who’d made sure the widow Van Holt got her pension after her
husband was killed in a “flagged” accident. I had earned my silence
here.</p>
<p>Marta was behind the bar, polishing a glass with a cloth. She saw me
and her face, usually a monument of weary stoicism, softened at the
edges. “The usual?”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>She poured a <em>jenever</em>, the glass clinking softly against the
bottle’s neck. She set it before me, then leaned her elbows on the bar,
lowering her voice. “Heard you had a meeting with the velvet glove.”</p>
<p>News traveled fast in the right channels. “I did.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“We reached an understanding. He keeps his velvet clean. I keep my
knives sharp.”</p>
<p>Marta snorted, a short, approving sound. “Good. Men like that, they
think a chair is a gift. They don’t know it’s just another thing to tie
you down.” She looked me over. “You look different. Not just the
clothes.”</p>
<p>I knew what she meant. The anxiety that used to live in my shoulders,
the constant hum of <em>what if I’m wrong, what if they see through
me</em>, was gone. It had been replaced by a low, steady current of
certainty. I had been wrong. I had been seen through. And I had survived
it. I had used it. The fear hadn’t vanished; it had been metabolized
into fuel.</p>
<p>“I’m not waiting for the hook anymore, Marta,” I said, sipping the
sharp, clean liquor. “I’m reading the current.”</p>
<p>She gave that nod, the one that was the highest form of praise in
this room. “About time.”</p>
<p>I finished my drink, the heat of it spreading through my chest. I
left coins on the bar, another ritual now understood. As I turned to go,
the door opened, letting in a gust of damp air and a young woman. She
was maybe twenty, her coat too thin for the weather, her eyes scanning
the room with a mixture of defiance and trepidation. The conversation
dipped, just for a second. Heads turned.</p>
<p>She saw the looks, hunched her shoulders, and made for a small, empty
table near the back, trying to project an indifference she clearly
didn’t feel.</p>
<p>I stopped. I felt every eye in the room, felt the weight of the
moment. The old script demanded I leave, that I mind my own business,
that I prove I belonged by not rocking this particular boat. The new
script, the one I was writing, demanded something else.</p>
<p>I walked over to her table. She looked up, wary, ready for a
challenge.</p>
<p>“The <em>jenever</em> is good here,” I said, my voice neutral. “But
the <em>bitterballen</em> are better if you’re hungry. Marta behind the
bar knows everyone. If you’re looking for work, tell her what you can
do. If you’re in trouble, tell her what you need. She doesn’t suffer
fools, but she doesn’t judge the desperate either.”</p>
<p>The girl stared at me, her defiance melting into confusion, then a
dawning, cautious understanding. She gave a tiny nod.</p>
<p>I didn’t smile. I just returned the nod, then turned and walked out,
leaving the warmth of the bodies and the murmur of their talk behind
me.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The apartment was quiet. It was no longer just a place to hide; it
was a place to think. The files were gone from the floor, sorted,
actioned, or archived. A single, sturdy desk stood by the window,
holding a modern telephone, a ledger of my own, and a framed photograph:
me and the team from the <em>Komet</em>, taken the day after the customs
house sting, all of us grinning under a pale spring sun.</p>
<p>I shrugged off my tweed jacket and hung it up. From a small cabinet,
I took out the steel flask. It was dented, its surface scratched from a
year in my pocket, through fights and flights and long, cold watches. I
unscrewed the cap and poured a measure of the same <em>jenever</em> into
a small glass. I didn’t drink to forget or to fortify myself. I drank to
mark the moment. To taste the difference.</p>
<p>I sat at the desk and opened my ledger. Not Van der Linde’s hidden
one, but mine. A record of balances. Debts settled. Promises kept. Loose
ends. There were fewer now. The thread of the <em>Westindische</em> fire
was tied off, its arsonist awaiting trial, his backers nervously silent.
The Kinderdijk land scheme was unspooled, the documents now in the hands
of a newspaper editor who owed me nothing but a good story. The man who
had tried to have me drowned in the cold canal water was serving time
for tax evasion, a fittingly mundane end.</p>
<p>The major threads were resolved. But a story isn’t a piece of
knitting; it doesn’t end with a neat, clipped yarn. It frays into the
future. My thread was now woven into the fabric of the city—into the
wary respect of the port, into the cold calculus of the Herengracht,
into the uncertain hope in a young woman’s eyes in a bar. I was part of
its ecosystem now, a predator, a cleaner, a fixed point.</p>
<p>The lens through which I’d seen everything—gender—hadn’t shattered.
It had clarified. It was no longer just a barrier; it was a tool, a
disguise, a weapon, a source of strength they consistently
underestimated. I hadn’t overcome it. I had integrated it. I was not a
woman acting like a man in a man’s world. I was a woman operating in a
world I was helping to reshape, using every tool my experience had given
me.</p>
<p>I closed the ledger. The invitation to De Zilveren Egel lay beside
it. A new door. A more dangerous game, played on polished floors with
unspoken rules. I felt no anxiety, only a focused curiosity. I would go.
I would listen. I would learn the new language of power, the one spoken
in nods and silences and the strategic placement of names. And I would
use it, not to join their club, but to ensure my own territory remained
inviolate. To ensure that the Martas of this city had a little more
leverage, that the young women walking into hostile rooms felt a little
less alone.</p>
<p>The rain had stopped. Outside, the city gleamed under a sky washed
clean, the lights of the port and the stadhuis reflecting in the
countless puddles like scattered constellations. The hum was there, the
deep, contented purr, but I could hear the individual notes within it
now: the groan of a ship, the distant clang of a tram, the laughter from
an open café door.</p>
<p>I finished the <em>jenever</em>, the final warmth of it spreading
through me. I placed the glass down, the click firm and final in the
quiet room.</p>
<p>I had arrived here a year ago, a needle driven by the rain, seeking
only shelter from the storm. I was leaving this chapter not as a needle,
but as a compass. The storm wasn’t over; the storm was the world. But I
had built a boat. I had charted the currents. I had learned to sail.</p>
<p>I turned off the desk lamp, leaving the room in the soft, blue-grey
light of the city at night. I didn’t look back at the room. I looked out
the window, at the endless, shifting pattern of light and shadow and
water, at the great, sleeping beast of the city.</p>
<p>I pulled on my jacket, my fingers brushing the cool metal of the
flask in its pocket. A familiar anchor. A reminder of where the
waterline was.</p>
<p>I opened the door to the hall and stepped out, not into an ending,
but into the perpetual, resonant beginning of the next thing. The
corridor stretched before me, leading to the stairs, to the street, to
the next door waiting to be pushed open.</p>
<p>I walked toward it, ready.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-13-1"><strong>Chapter 13</strong></h2>
<p>The invitation from Egel arrived not by post, but by courier. A
thick, cream-colored card, the address embossed in a severe, elegant
type. It was placed directly into my hand by a young man in a dark coat
who waited on the landing until I took it, his expression as blank as a
closed door. No words were exchanged. The transaction was complete the
moment the paper left his gloved fingers and touched mine.</p>
<p>I carried it inside, to the desk by the window. The city below was a
study in muted golds and deep blues, the evening light lying across the
rooftops like worn velvet. I did not open it immediately. I let it sit
on the scarred wood, a foreign artifact in my familiar space. Its
presence was a pressure, a slight but definite shift in the atmosphere
of the room, like the arrival of a silent, well-dressed guest.</p>
<p>Finally, I slid a thumb under the flap. The paper gave way with a
soft, expensive sigh.</p>
<p><em>Mevrouw de Vries,</em> it began. Not ‘Els’. The formality was the
first move. <em>You are requested for an evening of conversation at the
residence of Mijnheer A. Egel, Keizersgracht 724. Eight o’clock.
Informal.</em></p>
<p>The date was tomorrow. The assumption of availability, the second
move. ‘Informal’ was the third, and the most complex. In the world of
the <em>jenever</em> glass and the zinc counter, informal meant rolled
sleeves and loosened collars. Here, it was a code. It meant no tails, no
ballgowns, but it did not mean no armor. It meant the knives would be
smaller, better concealed, their cuts delivered with a smile.</p>
<p>I placed the card back on the desk. A focused curiosity, that was
what I had felt. It remained, but it was now cold, a surgeon’s
curiosity. I would go. I would listen. I would learn the language. But
first, I had to choose my own uniform for this informal war.</p>
<hr />
<p>The dress was a weapon, and like any good weapon, it was a
compromise. I found it in a small, stubborn shop run by a widow whose
eyes held the same flinty assessment as my own. It was a deep, smoky
grey, the color of the North Sea under a winter sky. The cut was severe,
almost masculine in the line of the shoulders, but the fabric was a
heavy, fluid silk that moved with a whisper. It covered me from throat
to wrist to ankle, yet the way it fell suggested the shape beneath
without concession. It was armor, but armor that acknowledged the
battlefield. It said: <em>I see your game. I am playing. But I have not
forgotten my own rules.</em></p>
<p>The widow, Marta—of course her name was Marta—nodded once as I turned
before her mirror. “It needs no jewelry,” she said, her voice like
rustling paper. “It would be an insult. Like gilding a rifle.”</p>
<p>I paid her in cash, the notes passing between us with the solemnity
of a treaty. She wrapped the dress in tissue, then in plain brown paper.
“Good luck,” she said, as I took the parcel. It wasn’t a pleasantry. It
was an intelligence report from a veteran of a different, older
front.</p>
<p>The night of the invitation, I dressed slowly. The silk was cool
against my skin. I did my hair, pinning it back in a way that was neat
but not ornate. My face in the mirror was pale, sharp, all angles and
watchfulness. I looked like what I was: a creature from a different
ecosystem, carefully adapted for a night in a more rarefied atmosphere.
I would not blend. I would contrast.</p>
<p>The final touch was the flask. I filled it with the good
<em>jenever</em>, the one Jan kept under the counter for special
occasions, which usually meant funerals or near-death experiences. I
slid it into a small, matching grey silk pouch I’d stitched, and tucked
it into the hidden pocket within the seam of the dress. An anchor. A
reminder of the waterline.</p>
<p>A taxi, summoned by a call from the café phone, took me to the
Keizersgracht. The canal houses floated in the darkness, their gabled
facades illuminated like stage sets, golden light spilling from enormous
windows onto the black water. Number 724 was a giant, a monument to
restrained wealth. I paid the driver and stood on the cobbles, looking
up. The hum of the city was different here. It was the hum of money, of
engines purring inside polished automobiles, of crystal clinking, a
higher, more brittle frequency.</p>
<p>The door was opened by a man in a black suit before I could lift the
knocker. He was older, his face a mask of professional neutrality.
“Mevrouw de Vries,” he said, stepping back. He knew. They all knew. I
was expected, my name and likely my biography already circulated among
the staff. I was the evening’s novelty.</p>
<p>I crossed the threshold into a silence so profound it felt like a
physical substance. The entrance hall was a vault of marble and dark
wood, a single, monstrous flower arrangement on a central table
screaming color into the stillness. My footsteps were swallowed by an
immense Persian carpet. The air smelled of beeswax, old books, and the
faint, dry scent of orchids.</p>
<p>“The gathering is in the library,” the man said, gesturing to an
arched doorway. “May I take your coat?”</p>
<p>I had no coat. I had only the dress and the hidden flask. “No, thank
you,” I said. My voice, used to cutting through the din of De Visser,
sounded too loud, too raw in the cushioned quiet. I saw the faintest
flicker in his eyes. Another note for his report: <em>Declines courtesy.
Possibly armed.</em></p>
<p>I walked toward the arch, the silk whispering a warning with every
step.</p>
<p>The library was not a room; it was a landscape. Two stories of books
climbed the walls, accessed by a slender, wrought-iron gallery. A fire
crackled in a fireplace large enough to roast an ox, and the light from
it danced across the faces of a dozen people. They stood in small
constellations, holding glasses of wine or whiskey. The conversation was
a low, polished murmur.</p>
<p>Every head turned as I entered. The murmur did not stop, but it
dipped, recalibrated. I was a new variable in the equation.</p>
<p>Egel detached himself from a group near the fire. He wore a dark
suit, no tie, the ‘informality’ on him looking like a statesman’s
leisure. “Els,” he said, extending a hand. He used my first name here,
in his fortress. A reclamation of territory. “I’m so pleased you could
come.”</p>
<p>I took his hand. His grip was firm, dry, assessing. “Mijnheer Egel.
Thank you for the invitation.”</p>
<p>“Aad, please. We are informal.” His smile was a professional tool,
well-maintained. “Come, let me introduce you.”</p>
<p>The introductions were a masterclass in the new language. He did not
say, “This is Els de Vries, she runs a questionable café and solves
problems for desperate women.” He said, “This is Mevrouw de Vries. She
has an remarkable understanding of our city’s less-charted
neighborhoods.” Or, “Mevrouw de Vries possesses a singular practical
expertise.”</p>
<p>The men shook my hand, their eyes performing a rapid, professional
appraisal—not of my body, but of my potential utility or threat. Their
handshakes were brief, their nods precise. The women were different.
Their smiles were perfect, their greetings warm, but their eyes held a
deeper, more complex calculus. They were experts in this environment,
fluent in its subtle hierarchies. They saw the dress, understood its
statement, and were determining whether I was a challenger, a curiosity,
or a potential ally in their own, unspoken games. One, a woman in her
fifties with a face of serene, sharp intelligence and a necklace of raw
amber, held my gaze a beat longer. “I’ve heard your name,” she said, her
voice soft. “In interesting contexts.”</p>
<p>“I find interesting contexts have a way of finding me, Mevrouw…?”</p>
<p>“Van Dijk.” She smiled, and it reached her eyes. “The feeling is
mutual.”</p>
<p>Egel guided me to a sideboard where a man in a white jacket stood
behind an array of bottles. “What may I offer you? We have an excellent
Bordeaux, or a single malt, if you prefer.”</p>
<p>The <em>jenever</em> in my hidden flask called to me, a base note of
the real world. But to drink it here would be to raise a flag of
otherness, a declaration of separation. To accept their wine was to play
their game on their board.</p>
<p>“Whiskey,” I said. “Neat.”</p>
<p>A slight elevation of Egel’s eyebrow. A small point scored, or
perhaps ceded. The barman poured two fingers of a tawny gold liquid into
a heavy crystal glass. I took it, let the heat of the spirit bloom in
the space between my palm and the cool crystal.</p>
<p>For an hour, I sailed. I moved from constellation to constellation, a
dark star passing through their ordered heavens. I listened. The talk
was of politics, but not the street-level graft I knew; it was of
policy, of influence, of the gentle steering of great ships of state and
commerce. It was of art acquisitions, of charitable foundations, of
zoning laws for the docklands redevelopment. Names were dropped like
chess pieces: the Burgemeester, a certain Minister, the head of the Port
Authority. I said little. I asked concise questions. I learned that a
man’s true opinion was often revealed in what he dismissed, and a
woman’s power was often located in the quiet amendment she made to her
husband’s statement.</p>
<p>I was circling back toward the fire, a refill of whiskey in my hand—a
prop, mostly, its level barely lowered—when I saw him. He stood slightly
apart, near the French doors leading to a terrace, studying a globe in a
stand. He was younger than most here, perhaps in his late thirties, with
a lean, restless frame that seemed uncomfortable in its well-tailored
clothes. His hair was a shade too long, his posture lacking the
ingrained, relaxed authority of the other men. He turned as I
approached, and his eyes were not assessing. They were interested,
openly and without guile.</p>
<p>“Contemplating escape?” I asked, nodding toward the terrace and the
dark garden beyond.</p>
<p>He smiled, a quick, genuine thing. “Is it that obvious? I find these
things… a bit airless.” He gestured with his own glass toward the room.
“I’m Simon.”</p>
<p>“Els.”</p>
<p>“I know.” He leaned a shoulder against the bookshelf. “You’re the
topic of the week. The mysterious woman from the docks who helped old
Martens’ daughter. And who told Aad Egel ‘no’, then ‘maybe’, all in one
conversation.”</p>
<p>So the story had traveled, polished and simplified in the telling.
“The facts are roughly correct. The mystery is overstated.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that.” He took a drink. “Aad’s fascinated. He collects
unique things. People included.”</p>
<p>“And you? What do you collect?”</p>
<p>“Problems,” he said, and the smile turned wry. “I’m a lawyer. A bad
one, according to my father.” He nodded toward a tall, silver-haired man
holding court by the mantel. “He thinks I should be managing the family
holdings, not defending squatters’ rights or fighting the Port Authority
on behalf of small fishermen.”</p>
<p>The statement was a grenade rolled casually onto the polished floor.
It was a test. I watched it lie there between us. “That sounds like more
interesting work,” I said, neutrally.</p>
<p>His eyes lit. “It is. It’s also a fantastic way to become the
disappointing son.” He looked at me directly. “You’ve made a space for
yourself outside all this. That’s… impressive.”</p>
<p>“It’s necessary,” I corrected. “Spaces don’t exist. They’re
taken.”</p>
<p>Before he could reply, Egel was beside us, his timing impeccable.
“Simon, monopolizing our guest of honor?” His tone was avuncular, but
there was a steel thread in it. “Els, there’s someone I’d like you to
meet. A fellow pragmatist.”</p>
<p>Simon gave a slight, almost imperceptible shrug of surrender. “A
pleasure, Mevrouw de Vries.”</p>
<p>Egel led me away, his hand a light, proprietary pressure on my elbow.
He steered me to a corner where a man stood alone, watching the room
with the calm, detached gaze of a sniper. He was compact, bald, his face
unreadable.</p>
<p>“Els, this is Maarten Brink. Maarten handles… special logistics for
several of our civic projects.”</p>
<p>Brink offered a hand. His grip was crushing, brief, and devoid of any
human warmth. It was a functional grip, like operating a lever. “De
Vries.” His voice was a low rasp. “Egel speaks highly of your
resourcefulness.”</p>
<p>“I solve local problems,” I said.</p>
<p>“So do I.” His eyes were the color of old ice. “On a larger scale.
The docklands redevelopment, for instance. A complex problem. Many
moving parts. Some of them… resistant.”</p>
<p>The conversation with Simon about fishermen and squatters’ rights
echoed in my head. I took a sip of whiskey, let the burn focus me.
“Resistance is often a matter of perspective.”</p>
<p>“Perspective can be adjusted,” Brink said evenly. “With the right
leverage. Or the right removal of leverage.” He paused, his gaze fixed
on me. “I understand you have a talent for finding leverage in
unexpected places. That is a valuable talent. Aligning local… stability…
with broader progress is crucial.”</p>
<p>It was not a threat. It was colder than that. It was a strategic
assessment. He was measuring me, not as a woman or a curiosity, but as a
piece on the board. A piece that could be useful, or could become an
obstruction to be cleared.</p>
<p>Egel watched us, a benign smile on his face. He had brought me here
for this. Not for the wine or the firelight, but for this moment in the
corner. To see how I would stand under Brink’s glacial gaze. To see if I
understood the game being played on the polished floors.</p>
<p>“Stability is my primary concern,” I said, meeting Brink’s eyes. “The
stability of my neighborhood. My people. Progress that shatters that is
just a different kind of storm.”</p>
<p>Brink’s lips twitched in something that was not a smile. “Storms
pass. The landscape after is what matters.”</p>
<p>The verbal chess match was broken by Van Dijk, the woman with the
amber necklace. She slipped her arm through mine with a practiced ease.
“Aad, Maarten, you are being dreadfully serious. You’ll frighten her
away. Come, Els, I want your opinion on a terrible painting my husband
insists on buying.”</p>
<p>She drew me away, her grip firm. When we were out of earshot, near a
hideous, gilded landscape, she dropped the social smile. Her voice was
low and urgent. “Be careful of Brink. He is not a man. He is a function.
A demolition function.”</p>
<p>“Why tell me this?”</p>
<p>“Because you are a new piece on the board,” she said, echoing my own
thought. “And the board is tipping. My husband is on the planning
committee. Brink’s ‘special logistics’ for the docklands involve
clearing the old warehouses—the ones full of artists, and squatters, and
those fishermen your new friend Simon is so fond of. Quietly.
Efficiently. No messy protests.”</p>
<p>“And Egel?”</p>
<p>“Aad believes in order. A clean, prosperous city. He sees Brink as
the broom that sweeps clean. He sees you as someone who understands the
dust.” She patted my arm, the social smile returning as a man
approached. “Think on it, my dear. The invitation tonight was not to
socialize. It was to observe the tools in the shed.”</p>
<p>The evening wound down. Goodbyes were performed, a symphony of
insincere warmth and promised future meetings. Egel saw me to the door
himself. “I hope it was not too tedious,” he said.</p>
<p>“It was illuminating,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Good. We should talk again soon. About the city. Our shared
interests.” He held the door open. The cold night air rushed in, a
shocking, welcome relief. “A car is waiting for you.”</p>
<p>I did not argue. The black sedan idled at the curb. I slid into the
back seat, the scent of leather and privilege filling my lungs. As the
car pulled away from the glowing monument of 724 Keizersgracht, I
finally let my breath out, a long, slow stream in the dark.</p>
<p>I had learned the language. I had seen the board. Brink was the
threat, a cold force of eradication disguised as progress. Egel was the
architect, willing to use any tool. Simon was a potential fracture line,
a source of information. Van Dijk was an ally of convenience, a player
with her own agenda.</p>
<p>And I was not a piece to be moved. I was a fact. A piece of the
landscape they intended to remodel.</p>
<p>The car dropped me at the foot of my own street. I walked the last
distance, the cobbles hard and familiar under my thin soles. The hum
here was my hum: the distant shout, the bass from a basement bar, the
smell of fried dough and wet stone.</p>
<p>Inside my room, I shut the door on the world of crystal and quiet
threats. I stripped off the grey silk, hung it carefully. It had served
its purpose. In my underclothes, I pulled the flask from its hidden
pocket, unscrewed the cap, and took a long, unmediated swallow of
<em>jenever</em>. The fire of it was truth, was home.</p>
<p>I stood at the window, looking at my city, the real one. The great,
sleeping beast. Brink and Egel saw it as a machine to be optimized, a
canvas to be whitewashed. They saw the warehouses as blots, the
fishermen as rust, the Martas as sentimental clutter.</p>
<p>I saw the beast’s ecosystem. The warehouses were its hollow bones,
sheltering life in the marrow. The fishermen were its link to the deep,
old blood of the sea. The Martas were its immune system.</p>
<p>They planned a demolition. A clean, efficient removal of
leverage.</p>
<p>I felt no anxiety. Only a cold, focused clarity. They had shown me
their hand. They believed their game, played on polished floors with
unspoken rules, was the only one that mattered.</p>
<p>But I knew a secret. The most dangerous game is not played in a
library by a fire. It is played in the streets, in the rain, in the
spaces between. It is played by those with nothing to lose but their
place in the ecosystem. I had built a boat. I had charted the currents.
And I knew how to sail into a storm, or how to create one.</p>
<p>I would not fight their war on their terms. I would not plead or
protest.</p>
<p>I would go to the warehouses. I would find the artists, the
squatters, the fishermen Simon tried to defend. I would not offer help.
I would offer a simple, brutal equation: their problem was my problem.
Brink’s “special logistics” relied on fear, on isolation, on picking off
the weak one by one.</p>
<p>I would make that impossible. I would weave the disparate, resistant
threads of the docklands into a net. A net strong enough to snag the
broom that sought to sweep them clean.</p>
<p>I finished the <em>jenever</em>, the final warmth a covenant with
myself. The invitation had been a door into their world. My response
would be a door of my own making, slammed shut in theirs, protecting
what was mine.</p>
<p>The city gleamed below, its constellations of light reflected in a
thousand dark puddles. The storm wasn’t coming. I was the storm. And I
would break where I chose.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-14-1"><strong>Chapter 14</strong></h2>
<p>The rain had gentled to a persistent, whispering drizzle by the time
I reached the docklands. It was the kind of rain that didn’t fall so
much as it seeped, finding every weakness in the asphalt, every crack in
the mortar, the very air a cold, damp cloth pressed against the face.
The city’s polished heart was miles away, a memory of electric light and
silent carpets. Here, the only light was the sickly orange glow of the
few streetlamps still functioning, their light swallowed by the fog
rolling in off the water. The smell was different, too—not fryer grease
and stale beer, but wet rust, rotting wood, and the profound, ancient
stink of the river at low tide.</p>
<p>The warehouses loomed like the skeletons of beached whales, their
vast, dark shapes hunched against the skyline. Brink and Egel saw blots.
I saw topography. I saw the high ground.</p>
<p>My first stop was the one they called the <em>Bakstenen Reus</em>—the
Brick Giant. It was the largest of the condemned structures, a fortress
of crumbling red brick and boarded-up windows. Inside, it was a kingdom
of echoes and stolen electricity. The ground floor was a cavernous
space, the ceiling lost in shadow, strung with a web of extension cords
that fed a constellation of bare bulbs. They illuminated a chaotic,
vibrant sprawl: makeshift studios partitioned by stained bedsheets,
sculptures welded from scrap metal looming like silent sentinels, the
acrid tang of oil paint and turpentine cutting through the damp.</p>
<p>Heads lifted as I entered, a dozen pairs of eyes catching the
movement from their canvases and workbenches. The conversation, a low
murmur of ideas and complaint, didn’t stop, but it changed pitch. It
became a watchful hum. I was an anomaly here, too. Not a stray cat this
time, but a bird of prey landing in a dovecote. My coat was too good, my
posture too straight. I carried the chill of the outside world in with
me.</p>
<p>A man peeled away from a group huddled around a space heater, wiping
his hands on paint-stained trousers. He was young, with a sharp,
intelligent face and eyes that were older than the rest of him. Raf, I
remembered. Simon had pointed him out once, called him the unofficial
mayor of the Reus.</p>
<p>“Els,” he said, not a question. His voice was flat, devoid of Jan’s
transactional gruffness. This was a different currency. “Heard you were
asking around. After what happened to Simon.”</p>
<p>I didn’t nod. I held his gaze, let the silence between us stretch
until it became its own kind of answer. “I’m not here to ask,” I said.
My voice was quiet, but it carried in the echo chamber of the space. A
few more people looked over. “I’m here to tell. The eviction notices on
these walls? They’re not the city’s. They’re a private concern. A
company called Brink Holdings.”</p>
<p>Raf’s expression didn’t flicker. “We know who owns the paper. It
doesn’t change the locks they’ll put on the doors.”</p>
<p>“It does,” I said. I took a step further in, letting the weak light
fall on my face. “Because the city follows rules. Slow, stupid,
bureaucratic rules. Appeals. Hearings. Delays. Brink doesn’t. He uses
‘special logistics.’ Men who don’t wear uniforms, who work at night. Who
make problems disappear before the sun comes up.”</p>
<p>I saw it then, the minute tightening around his eyes. They’d seen it
already. A slashed canvas. Tools gone missing. A fire in a trash bin
that got a little too close to the bedding area. Nuisance stuff. The
kind that breeds a slow, grinding fear.</p>
<p>“What’s your interest?” a woman’s voice cut in. She emerged from
behind a large, abstract canvas streaked with furious reds and blacks.
Marta. Of course there was a Marta here. Her hair was tied back in a
practical knot, her hands raw and chapped. An artist, but her eyes were
the same as all the Martas—assessing, pragmatic, rooted in the physical
world.</p>
<p>“They made it my interest,” I said, turning to include her. “They
tried to buy my silence. My compliance. They showed me their plans. A
clean sweep. Art galleries where this stands. Wine bars where the
fishermen mend their nets. They don’t see you. They see rust.
Sentimental clutter.”</p>
<p>The word <em>clutter</em> did what my presence could not. It sparked
a low flame in the watchful eyes around me. Insult was a language they
understood far better than threat.</p>
<p>“So you come to warn us?” Raf asked, a thread of skepticism woven
through his tone. “A civic duty?”</p>
<p>I let out a short, breath that wasn’t a laugh. “I don’t do duty. I do
ecosystems. They’re picking you off one by one because you’re alone. The
artists here. The squatters in the <em>Noordelijke Loods</em>. The old
men on the fishing quay. Separate threads. Easy to snap.”</p>
<p>Marta crossed her arms. “And you’re going to weave us together?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. The simplicity of the word hung in the air. “You’re
going to weave yourselves. I’m just giving you the pattern. Their
strength is secrecy, speed, fear. Your weakness is isolation. Remove the
isolation, and their strength becomes a liability. A man swinging a
broom in an empty room is efficient. A man swinging a broom in a room
full of tripwires and glue is a fool.”</p>
<p>I reached into my coat, not for a weapon, but for a folded sheaf of
papers. Basic schematics of the dockland blocks, drawn from memory and
city archives. I laid them on a nearby worktable stained with a rainbow
of pigments. “You have lookouts. Use them. Not just for your own door.
The quay is your door. The <em>Loods</em> is your door. One sees
something, a van, men with tools after dark, they don’t hide. They sound
an alarm. A specific one. A light pattern. A siren from that old boat
horn on the quay. You all hear it, you all respond. Not to fight. To
witness. To be a crowd. To take pictures with those phones you charge on
stolen current. Brink’s men are ghosts. Flood them with light.”</p>
<p>Raf was studying the map, his finger tracing the lines between
warehouses. “A neighborhood watch. For squatters.”</p>
<p>“A net,” I corrected. “A single, irritable organism. You make it too
loud, too messy, too <em>visible</em> for their special logistics. They
rely on you being ashamed, being illegal, being afraid of the proper
authorities. Stop being afraid of the authorities. Start making the
authorities afraid of the scene <em>you’ll</em> create if they let
Brink’s cleaners operate.”</p>
<p>Marta was watching me, her head tilted. “This is a war,” she said,
not accusingly, but as a statement of fact.</p>
<p>“It’s pest control,” I replied, meeting her eyes. “And you are not
the pests.”</p>
<p>There was a longer silence. It was no longer wary, but calculating. I
could see the minds working, connecting the dots between their scattered
domains. The idea was not charity. It was not solidarity in the
bleeding-heart sense. It was tactical, selfish, and brutal. It appealed
to them because it was real.</p>
<p>“And you?” Raf asked finally. “Where are you in this net?”</p>
<p>I smiled then, a thin, cold show of teeth. “I’m the one who knows
where the broom is stored. And I’m the one who will break its
handle.”</p>
<p>I left them with the map, with the idea, a seed planted in fertile,
resentful ground. My next stop was the fishing quay, a narrower,
smellier kingdom of its own. The men here were older, their resistance
not of paint and theory, but of habit and salt-cured stubbornness. They
stood in small groups under tarpaulin awnings, mending nets with swift,
gnarled fingers, their conversations a series of grunts and observations
about the wind.</p>
<p>Their leader was not a leader at all, but the oldest of them, a man
named Piet with a face like a weathered cliff and eyes the color of the
winter sea. He listened to my same, stripped-down explanation, his hands
never stopping their rhythmic work with the net needle.</p>
<p>When I finished, he spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dark
water lapping at the pilings. “Crowds. Lights. Nonsense. When they come,
a crowbar is a better argument.”</p>
<p>“A crowbar gets you arrested,” I said, leaning against a moss-slick
bollard. “A crowd of fifty people with cameras gets you on the evening
news. Which one costs Brink more?”</p>
<p>Piet’s needle paused for a fraction of a second. His calculus was
different. It wasn’t about art or principle. It was about cost.
Annoyance. “My grandson,” he said, nodding toward a sullen young man
scaling fish with violent efficiency. “He has one of those phones.
Always filming nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Good,” I said. “Let him film. The world loves an old fisherman
getting pushed around by men in black jackets. It’s a better story than
a new wine bar.”</p>
<p>A grim, toothless approximation of a smile touched Piet’s mouth.
“Aye. We’re picturesque, until we’re in the way.” He looked out at the
river, at the fog swallowing the opposite bank. “The alarm. The boat
horn. We can do that. For Simon.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t agreement out of strategy. It was a debt, paid in
vigilance. It was stronger.</p>
<p>By the time I approached the <em>Noordelijke Loods</em>, the night
had deepened. This warehouse was the most derelict, home not to artists
but to those who had simply run out of everywhere else to go. The air
smelled of damp concrete, unwashed bodies, and the sweet-sour tang of
desperation. Here, the fear was a living thing, a cold draft that coiled
around the ankles.</p>
<p>I was met not by a spokesperson, but by a wall of silent, hostile
stares from the shadows. A woman eventually stepped forward, wrapped in
a blanket, her hair a wild tangle. She didn’t ask my name. “You bring
trouble or food?”</p>
<p>“Information,” I said, keeping my hands visible. “The trouble is
already coming. The information might blunt it.”</p>
<p>I gave the same speech, stripped even barer. No talk of ecosystems or
art. Just cause and effect. <em>Men will come to burn you out. Together
with the others, you can make it too difficult. You can make them choose
a softer target.</em></p>
<p>“Why would the artists care about us?” someone muttered from the
darkness.</p>
<p>“They wouldn’t,” I said, my voice cutting through the gloom. “And you
wouldn’t care about them. But you both care about not being thrown into
the rain. That’s the only thread you need. Hold onto it.”</p>
<p>The woman in the blanket studied me. Her eyes were exhausted, but not
stupid. “You’re the one from the bar. The one who knew Simon.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She nodded, once. “We listen for the horn.”</p>
<p>It was done. The connections were made, not with friendship, but with
the brittle, functional glue of shared threat. I had turned the
docklands from a collection of targets into a single, prickly hide.
Walking back through the drizzle, I felt the cold, focused clarity
solidify into something harder. A plan. A weapon I had forged from the
very resentment Brink had sought to exploit.</p>
<p>I didn’t go home. I went to De Visser. The warmth was a familiar
slap, the murmur a familiar soundtrack. Jan saw my face and poured the
<em>jenever</em> without a word. I took the glass, the first real heat
of the day spreading from my gut to my frozen fingers.</p>
<p>I had set the stage. Now I needed the players. Brink’s “special
logistics” would be a team, likely subcontracted, men who traded
violence for cash and discretion. They would have a base, a van, a
routine. I needed to find it. To see their faces. To know the broom
before it started to swing.</p>
<p>The door to the bar opened, letting in a gust of wet, cold air. A man
entered, shaking water from his dark wool coat. He wasn’t a regular. His
shoes were too clean, his frame too broad beneath the tailored fabric.
He didn’t look around with the curiosity of a stranger, but with the
scanning assessment of someone checking a perimeter.</p>
<p>He walked to the bar, two stools down from me, and ordered a beer.
His voice was low, accentless. He paid with exact change. He didn’t
drink, just turned the bottle slowly on the zinc, watching the
condensation make a wet ring.</p>
<p>He was a professional. And he was here, in this bar at the edge of
the docklands, on this particular night.</p>
<p>My pulse, which had been a slow, cold metronome, didn’t quicken. It
deepened. Became a heavier, more deliberate thud. I took a slow sip of
my <em>jenever</em>, letting the heat bloom on my tongue.</p>
<p>They weren’t waiting for the eviction date. They were doing
reconnaissance. Softening the ground. Perhaps they’d heard a whisper
that the disparate threads were stirring.</p>
<p>The man’s eyes, reflected in the smudged mirror behind the bar, slid
over the room and, for a fraction of a second, met mine. There was no
recognition in them. Only a flat, empty evaluation. A cataloging of
assets and obstacles. To him, I was just a woman in a bar, of no more
consequence than the stool she sat on.</p>
<p>He finished his beer, left the bottle precisely centered on its ring
of moisture, and walked back out into the rain.</p>
<p>I counted to thirty. Then I laid coins on the bar, a silent
transaction Jan acknowledged with a blink.</p>
<p>Outside, the drizzle had turned back into a needling rain. The street
was empty, but the taillights of a dark sedan were just disappearing
around the distant corner, heading not toward the city’s bright center,
but deeper into the industrial gloom, toward the river’s most forgotten
bend.</p>
<p>A location. A direction.</p>
<p>The net was strung. The broom was on the move.</p>
<p>And I knew where it was going to sleep tonight.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-15-1"><strong>Chapter 15</strong></h2>
<p>The river’s forgotten bend was a graveyard of ambition. Hulks of old
cranes stood against the bruised sky like the skeletons of giant,
arthritic birds. Warehouses, their windows boarded or gaping, slumped
against one another for support. The rain here was different. It didn’t
fall from the sky so much as it seeped from the bricks, dripped from
rusted iron, pooled in the cracked concrete underfoot—a cold, persistent
exhalation of the place itself.</p>
<p>I kept to the shadows where they were deep, moved through the patches
of sickly yellow light from the few working streetlamps where they were
not. My coat was a sodden weight. The <em>jenever</em>’s warmth was a
memory in my veins, replaced by a sharp, clean clarity. The dark sedan
was parked, empty, outside a two-story brick building that might have
once been a customs office. A faint, rhythmic glow came from a
second-floor window—the sweep of a flashlight beam.</p>
<p>They were inside. Doing their inventory.</p>
<p>I circled the block, my boots making no sound in the oily grit. The
building’s back was a cliff-face of brick, scarred by the ghost-lines of
torn-down fire escapes. A single metal door, banded with iron, was set
into the wall. A heavy padlock hung from the hasp, but the hasp itself
was new, the screws bright against the corroded steel of the door. A
recent upgrade. I ran a gloved finger along the jamb. Fine, almost
invisible scratches radiated from the lock. Picked, and not long
ago.</p>
<p>They hadn’t bothered to re-lock it behind them. Arrogance, or a
belief that no one would be fool enough to follow them into this wet,
dark throat of the city.</p>
<p>I was that fool. I eased the door open, a sliver of darkness yielding
to a deeper darkness within. The smell was immediate: damp rot, pigeon
droppings, and beneath it, the faint, coppery scent of old rust. And
something else. A dry, papery smell. Books.</p>
<p>The ground floor was a cavern, empty save for mounds of debris and
the pale, watching shapes of discarded machinery shrouded in plastic. A
set of wooden stairs against the far wall led up. The flashlight beam
strobed again from above, painting the ceiling with fleeting, geometric
shadows. Voices, muffled by distance and the drumming of rain on the
roof, filtered down. Two of them. A low, methodical exchange.</p>
<p>I took the stairs one at a time, placing my weight along the outer
edge where the wood was less likely to groan. The clarity in my head
narrowed to a tunnel: the next step, the next breath, the next sliver of
light from above.</p>
<p>The upper floor was a long, open space, once an office, now a shell.
Partitions had been torn out, leaving a forest of electrical conduits
and pipe stubs protruding from the floor. At the far end, in a pool of
light from two powerful electric lanterns set on the floor, the two men
worked.</p>
<p>The one from the bar—broad, tailored—was scanning the spines of books
stacked in precarious towers against the wall. He handled each volume
with a peculiar, surgical care, using the blade of a small knife to
gently separate pages, peering into the gutters. The other man was
younger, leaner, with a restless energy. He was prying up sections of
the wide-plank floor with a crowbar, his movements efficient, violent.
The dry, papery smell was stronger here, mixed with the scent of raw,
wet earth rising from the subfloor.</p>
<p>This was the cache. Not a single document, but a library. A history.
The physical proof of every deal, every name, every whispered promise
that had built the Syndicate’s power in this city. And the man with the
knife wasn’t just checking for hidden compartments. He was assessing,
selecting. He would take the core, the most damning ledgers. The
rest—the context, the minor players, the full story—would be left behind
for the city’s bulldozers, or for a carefully set fire once the
demolition crews moved in.</p>
<p>The broom wasn’t just sweeping. It was editing.</p>
<p>The younger man grunted, levering up a longer board. “Nothing under
this section. Just dirt and rats.”</p>
<p>“Keep looking,” the older man said, his voice the same flat,
accentless instrument I’d heard in the bar. “The map indicated a
secondary cavity. Three feet from the north wall, eight feet from the
west.”</p>
<p>“The map’s a century old. The walls have shifted.”</p>
<p>“The walls haven’t shifted. Your measurements are sloppy.”</p>
<p>A flicker of irritation crossed the younger man’s face, a crack in
the professional veneer. He didn’t like being corrected. He was muscle,
but he fancied himself a technician. A dangerous combination.</p>
<p>I melted back into the deeper darkness near the stairhead, behind a
thick, cast-iron heating column. My pulse was that heavy, deliberate
thud again. I was not an obstacle to them. I was a ghost. I could slip
back down the stairs, back into the rain, and they would never know. The
direction was confirmed. The net was here. But knowing the shape of the
trap wasn’t the same as springing it. To stop them, I’d have to become
an obstacle. And two professional men, one irritated, both armed, would
not see a woman in the dark as a person. They would see a problem to be
solved. Permanently.</p>
<p>The younger man slammed the crowbar down. “It’s not here. We’ve been
at this for two hours. We have the primary ledgers. Burn the rest and be
done with it.”</p>
<p>The older man didn’t look up from the folio he was examining. “We
follow the protocol. The secondary cache contains the beneficiary
registries. The names behind the names. Without them, this is just
accounting. With them, it is a weapon. Find it.”</p>
<p>The beneficiary registries. The true currency of the Syndicate. Not
just who owed, but who was owed. The politicians, the judges, the police
commissioners whose loyalty was purchased not with fear, but with
silent, compounding interest. It was the key to the kingdom, or its
destruction.</p>
<p>The younger man swore, low and vicious, and drove the crowbar’s claw
into the floor again. This time, the wood gave with a different
sound—not a splintering crack, but a hollow, echoing groan. He froze.
The older man looked up, his flashlight beam joining his partner’s on
the floor.</p>
<p>There, in the jagged hole, was not dirt, but the dull gleam of metal.
A long, flat box.</p>
<p>A slow, satisfied smile spread across the older man’s face. It was
the most chilling expression I’d seen yet. “There. Gently now.”</p>
<p>I watched as they lifted the box, a sealed tin case the length of a
rifle, out of the floor. It was heavy. The younger man carried it to a
cleared space near the lanterns and set it down with a soft thud. The
older man produced a set of lock picks from an inner pocket and went to
work on the simple clasp. His hands were steady, precise.</p>
<p>This was the moment. The core of the core was being exposed. Once it
was in their hands, in that sedan, it would vanish into a vault or an
incinerator, and the city’s memory would be surgically removed.</p>
<p>I stepped out from behind the column.</p>
<p>The sound of my foot settling on the gritty floor was soft, but in
the tense, silent focus of the room, it was a gunshot. Both men went
perfectly still. Then, as one, they turned. The younger man’s hand went
to his waist. The older man simply straightened up, his picks still in
the lock, and looked at me.</p>
<p>His eyes held the same flat evaluation they had in the bar’s mirror.
But now there was a flicker—not of alarm, but of recalculations. I was
no longer part of the scenery. I had inserted myself into the
equation.</p>
<p>“This is a restricted area,” he said, his voice devoid of any
inflection that could be construed as a question.</p>
<p>I said nothing. I let the silence stretch, let the rain on the roof
fill it. I took another step forward, into the fringe of the lantern
light. Let him see the damp wool coat, the wet hair plastered to my
skull, the empty hands.</p>
<p>The younger man drew his weapon, a compact, black automatic. He
didn’t point it at me, not yet. He held it down by his thigh, his body
coiled. “Who are you?”</p>
<p>The older man sighed, a faint exhalation of disappointment. “She’s no
one. A squatter. A addict looking for a dry place.” His eyes never left
mine. “Aren’t you?”</p>
<p>It was a test. A dismissal. A woman alone in this place could only be
those things. To be anything else violated the natural order he
understood.</p>
<p>“You’re taking what isn’t yours,” I said. My voice was rough from
disuse and the cold, but it didn’t waver.</p>
<p>The younger man barked a laugh. “Listen to her. It isn’t ours? And
it’s yours?”</p>
<p>“It belongs to the city,” I said. “To the people who bled for
it.”</p>
<p>The older man’s lip curled. He finally took his picks from the lock.
“Sentimentality. The most useless currency of all.” He nodded to his
partner. “Remove her. Quietly.”</p>
<p>The younger man moved forward, confident now. I was a nuisance to be
cleared. He holstered his weapon, deciding hands were enough. He was
bigger, younger, stronger. The logic was immutable.</p>
<p>As he reached for me, his hand aiming to clamp on my upper arm and
spin me toward the stairs, I didn’t pull away. I stepped into him. My
left hand came up, not to block his grab, but to guide it past me, while
my right drove stiffened fingers into the soft hollow at the base of his
throat. It was not a fight-ending blow. It was a punctuation. A
shocking, breath-stealing full stop in the narrative he was writing.</p>
<p>He gagged, his eyes bulging, and stumbled back a step. The surprise
on his face was absolute. I didn’t press the advantage. I simply stood
my ground, my hands falling back to my sides.</p>
<p>The older man’s flat gaze sharpened. The calculation in his eyes sped
up. “I see,” he murmured. He didn’t tell his partner to get up. He
assessed me anew. The sodden coat, the quiet stance, the precise,
economical violence. The puzzle pieces were not fitting the picture he
had pre-cut.</p>
<p>“You are not a squatter,” he stated.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You followed me from De Visser.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You work for one of the remnant families. Seeking leverage. Or
revenge.” He tilted his head. “A woman. They must be truly
desperate.”</p>
<p>He was building a new box to put me in. It was still the wrong one,
but it was more dangerous. I was now a known, if minor, adversary. An
asset of a defeated foe.</p>
<p>“I work for no one,” I said.</p>
<p>“Everyone works for someone.” He took a slow step to the side,
placing himself between me and the tin case. His right hand drifted
toward his own coat. “Even ghosts have to eat.”</p>
<p>The younger man had recovered his breath, his face mottled with rage
and humiliation. He drew his weapon again, this time leveling it at my
chest. “Enough of this. I’ll put her down, and we can finish.”</p>
<p>“No,” the older man said, his voice a whip-crack. The younger man
flinched. “She is not a stray dog. She is a message. Sent here. To be
seen.” His eyes drilled into me. “Who sent you? Van Houten? The widow
Aarden? Tell me, and your death will be quick. A professional
courtesy.”</p>
<p>He believed this was a power play. A dying faction’s pathetic attempt
to show they still had teeth, even if it was just a stray set they’d
found in an alley. My solitude, my gender, made any other explanation
inconceivable. I was a symbol, not an actor.</p>
<p>I used it. I let a slow, cold smile touch my lips—a show of teeth in
the currency he understood. “You’re afraid of the wrong people.”</p>
<p>It was the perfect spark. The younger man, his pride still bleeding,
saw the smile as a final insult. He shifted his weight, his finger
tightening on the trigger. “Fuck this.”</p>
<p>He fired.</p>
<p>The report was deafening in the enclosed space. But I was already
moving, not away, but toward the older man, using his body as a shield.
The bullet meant for me tore through the older man’s shoulder. He cried
out, a short, sharp sound of pure shock, and spun from the impact.</p>
<p>Chaos, true and absolute, erupted.</p>
<p>The younger man stared, horrified, at what he had done. The older man
was down on one knee, his good hand clutching his ruined shoulder, blood
welling dark between his fingers. His flat eyes were wide with pain and
a dawning, volcanic fury. “You idiot!” he snarled.</p>
<p>The younger man swung the gun back toward me, but the moment was
gone. His certainty was shattered. I kicked one of the electric
lanterns. It skittered across the floor, its beam cartwheeling madly,
throwing lunatic shadows, and slammed into the younger man’s shins. He
stumbled.</p>
<p>I didn’t go for him. I went for the case.</p>
<p>My hand closed around the cold handle. It was heavier than I
expected. The older man, from his knees, made a grab for my ankle. I
kicked back, my heel connecting with his wounded shoulder. He gasped,
his grip failing.</p>
<p>I ran. Not for the stairs—the younger man was between me and them—but
for the far end of the room, where the gaping windows looked out over
the river.</p>
<p>“Shoot her!” the older man roared, his voice ragged. “Shoot her
now!”</p>
<p>The younger man fired again, twice. Bullets whined past me, punching
into brick and timber. One shattered the remaining pane of glass in the
window I was heading for. The night air, cold and wet, rushed in.</p>
<p>I didn’t look back. I hurled the tin case through the jagged opening.
It vanished into the darkness. Then I followed it.</p>
<p>There was no fire escape, no ledge. Just a two-story drop into
blackness and the slick, angled roof of a lower annex. I hit it feet
first, the impact driving the air from my lungs, and slid down the wet
tiles in a cascade of broken moss and debris. I landed in a heap on a
mound of soggy cardboard and refuse in a narrow alley.</p>
<p>Pain bloomed in my ankle, my side. I ignored it, scrambling to my
feet, my eyes searching the darkness. The tin case lay a few feet away,
dented but intact.</p>
<p>Above, a flashlight beam stabbed out of the broken window, sweeping
the alley. A voice, furious, echoed down. “Find her! Find that
case!”</p>
<p>I grabbed the handle and ran, limping, into the labyrinth of the
river bend. The net was torn. The broom was bleeding. And I had stolen
its teeth.</p>
<p>But as I vanished into the dripping darkness, the older man’s words
echoed in the hammering of my heart and the throbbing in my ankle.
<em>She is a message.</em></p>
<p>He was wrong. I was not a message.</p>
<p>But the gunshots in the night were. And they would be heard. By the
wrong people. By the right people. By everyone. The silent, surgical
excision was over. Now it was a war. And I had just lit the fuse in the
one hand that could not afford to hold it.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-16-1"><strong>Chapter 16</strong></h2>
<p>The river bend was a wound in the city’s flesh, a place where the old
stone wept a constant, greasy damp. I moved through its arteries, my
breath a ragged saw in my throat, the tin case a dead weight that pulled
at my shoulder with every limping step. The ankle was a hot, tight knot
above my boot. Not broken. Sprained. A luxury of pain I could not
afford.</p>
<p>I did not head for my own rooms. That path was a known quantity, a
line they would draw the moment they had the breath to draw it. Instead,
I turned deeper into the maze, towards the places that even the rats
considered a downgrade. The buildings here leaned against each other for
support, their upper stories kissing over the narrow passages, blocking
out what little light the cloud-choked moon offered. The ground
underfoot was a slick paste of mud and things better not identified.</p>
<p>A message. The words were a cold stone in my gut, heavier than the
case. He had not meant a message for me. He had meant I was a message
<em>from</em> someone. A statement written in blood and bullets,
delivered to the doorstep of the men in that warehouse. But from who?
And to what end?</p>
<p>The only answer was the metallic taste of fear in my mouth and the
throbbing echo of the gunshots. They would be hunting now. Not just the
two men—the younger one with the efficient eyes, the older one with the
voice of command—but others. The net was not just torn; it was enraged.
A wounded animal is more dangerous than a whole one. It does not care
for its own skin.</p>
<p>I found a recessed doorway, the wood swollen and rotten, and pressed
myself into its shadow. I set the case down between my feet and
listened. The city’s night sounds filtered down: the distant clang of a
tram, a shout from a street over, the eternal whisper of the river.
Beneath it, the closer sounds: the scuttle in the garbage, the drip of
water from a broken gutter. No boots. No hushed, urgent voices.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>I looked at the case. It was a cheap thing, dented from its fall, the
green paint scarred to reveal dull metal beneath. A simple clasp, no
lock. The teeth of the broom. I knelt, the movement sending a fresh
lance of pain up my leg, and worked the clasp. It was stiff, corroded.
It gave with a reluctant screech that seemed to echo off the wet
bricks.</p>
<p>Inside, nestled in fitted slots of faded velvet, were six syringes.
They were not medical. They were heavy-gauge glass, thick-walled, with
plungers of polished brass. Each was filled with a clear, viscous fluid.
No labels. No markings. Beside them, lying in a separate channel, was a
sheaf of papers, folded tight and sealed with a blob of red wax stamped
with a symbol I did not recognize—a stylized ‘V’ intertwined with a
caduceus.</p>
<p>I did not touch the syringes. I pried the papers free, breaking the
seal with my thumbnail. The wax crumbled like old blood. I unfolded
them, angling the page to catch the faint ambient glow from a distant
streetlamp.</p>
<p>They were shipping manifests. Lists. In a neat, bureaucratic hand.
Dates. Times. Dock numbers. Ship names. And names of men. Some I knew.
Middlemen. Stevedore foremen. Two city aldermen. And at the bottom of
each page, a signature. A florid, arrogant scrawl I knew too well:
<em>Van Houten</em>.</p>
<p>The blood in my veins went still. Van Houten was not just a name. He
was an institution. A man who sat on charitable boards and dined with
the chief of police. His warehouses lined the commercial docks,
legitimate fronts for God knew what. And here was his hand, directing
the flow of these unmarked syringes through the city’s port like so much
grain or timber.</p>
<p>A medicine? A poison? A new kind of fear, distilled into glass?</p>
<p>The syringes glinted dully in the dark. They were not a weapon. They
were a currency. A promise. Or a threat. The kind of thing you use to
buy silence, to ensure loyalty, to break a will without leaving a mark.
The kind of thing a man like Van Houten would use to sweep a problem
clean away. A surgical excision.</p>
<p>But the surgery had gone wrong. The patient had fought back. And I
had stolen the scalpel.</p>
<p>I refolded the papers, my fingers clumsy with cold and something
deeper, a dread that was settling into my bones. I slipped them into my
inner coat pocket, against my ribs. The syringes I left in their case. I
closed the lid. The clasp clicked shut, a final, hollow sound.</p>
<p>I could not run far with the ankle. I needed a hole. A temporary
burrow. There was only one person in this bend who owed me a favor that
wasn’t measured in coin. A debt of a different kind.</p>
<p>Marta.</p>
<p>She ran a <em>kroeg</em> even smaller and fouler than De Visser, a
place where the air was solid with the smell of boiled tripe and
despair. It was a woman’s place, mostly. The wives and daughters and
worn-out mistresses of the men who drank at Jan’s. They came to Marta
for a glass of something sharp, for a listening ear that asked no
questions, for a back room where a person could disappear for a few
hours. Or a few days.</p>
<p>I had once found Marta’s son, Pieter, not ten years old, being used
as a runner by a pill-peddler from the eastern docks. I had not done it
for her. I had done it because the sight of the boy’s thin, frightened
face in that gutter had been a reflection I could not abide. But Marta
had called it a debt. “One day,” she’d said, her eyes hard as flint.
“You will need a door that is not watched. That day, you come to
me.”</p>
<p>Today was that day.</p>
<p>I hefted the case and pushed off from the doorway. The pain was a
constant companion now, a rhythm to match my limping gait. I kept to the
deepest shadows, my senses stretched taut, listening for the tell-tale
rhythm of a pursuit that did not belong here. Twice I froze, pressing
into alcoves, as figures passed the mouth of an alley. Once a pair of
drunkards, weaving and singing. Once a lone watchman, his footsteps slow
and bored. Neither were hunters.</p>
<p>Marta’s place was in the basement of a collapsed tannery, marked only
by a faded blue door below street level. A single, flyblown bulb glowed
above it. I took the steps down slowly, each one a jolt. I did not
knock. I turned the handle and pushed inside.</p>
<p>The warmth here was different from De Visser. It was closer, denser,
smelling of cheap perfume, stewed tea, and unwashed hair. The low
ceiling was stained brown from smoke. A handful of women sat at small
tables, their postures weary, their conversations hushed. They looked up
as I entered. Their eyes were not hostile, but they were not welcoming.
They were the eyes of creatures who knew the value of shadows and the
danger of new things.</p>
<p>Marta stood behind a makeshift bar—a plank laid across two barrels.
She was a thin woman, all sharp angles and tight, grey bun, her face a
roadmap of hard living. She was polishing a glass with a cloth that was
no cleaner than the glass. She did not look up.</p>
<p>“We’re closed,” she said, her voice a dry rustle.</p>
<p>“It’s Els.”</p>
<p>Her polishing stopped. She looked up. Her eyes, a pale, watery blue,
took me in: the mud, the torn coat, the obvious favor my ankle was doing
me, the tin case. She did not ask. She gave a short, sharp nod towards a
curtain of stained sacking at the back of the room.</p>
<p>“Pieter,” she called, not raising her voice. A boy, now thirteen and
all elbows and knees, appeared from behind the curtain. “Watch the bar.
No credit. Not even for breath.”</p>
<p>The boy nodded, his eyes wide as he looked at me. I followed Marta
through the sacking into a small, square room. It held a cot, a chair, a
small stove with a kettle on it, and a pervasive smell of camphor. She
pointed to the cot.</p>
<p>“Sit.”</p>
<p>I sat. The relief of taking weight off the ankle was so profound it
was almost a pain in itself. I set the case on the floor beside me.</p>
<p>Marta busied herself with the kettle, lighting the stove with a
match. “The ankle?”</p>
<p>“Sprained.”</p>
<p>“You’ll live.” She rummaged in a cupboard, pulled out a bottle of
clear liquid and a roll of yellowed linen. “The rest?”</p>
<p>“Bullets. They missed.”</p>
<p>She poured a generous measure of the liquid—it smelled of anise and
fire—into a tin mug and handed it to me. “Drink. For the shock.” Then
she knelt, without ceremony, and began to unlace my boot. Her hands were
surprisingly gentle. She peeled the boot and sock off, her lips pursing
at the sight of the swollen, discolored joint. She poured some of the
liquor onto the cloth and began to bind the ankle, tight and expert.</p>
<p>“Who?” she asked, not looking up.</p>
<p>“Men in a warehouse by the commercial docks. They work for Van
Houten.”</p>
<p>Her hands stilled for a fraction of a second. Then she continued
winding the bandage. “Van Houten. You stick your hand into a high nest,
girl.”</p>
<p>“They stuck it in for me. I just pulled back hard.”</p>
<p>“And took something with you.” Her eyes flicked to the case.</p>
<p>I said nothing. The liquor was burning a path to my stomach,
spreading a false warmth. Marta finished the bandage, tied it off, and
sat back on her heels. She looked at me, really looked, her gaze
stripping away the mud and the bravado.</p>
<p>“You are trouble,” she stated. Not an accusation. A fact, like the
weather. “The kind that brings other trouble to my door.”</p>
<p>“I need until dawn. Then I’m gone.”</p>
<p>“And then? They will be looking for a limping woman with a tin case.
Every pair of eyes on the river will have a price on them by morning.”
She stood, brushing her hands on her apron. “You leave the case. You
leave the coat. You become someone else for a few hours.”</p>
<p>“I can’t leave the case.”</p>
<p>“Then you are a dead woman walking, and you will die in someone
else’s house. My debt is for a door, not a coffin.” Her voice was flat.
“What is in it that is worth your life?”</p>
<p>I thought of the syringes. The manifests. Van Houten’s signature.
“Proof,” I said, the word tasting bitter. “Of something I don’t yet
understand.”</p>
<p>Marta sighed, a sound of profound weariness. “Understanding is a
luxury for people with safe beds.” She walked to a trunk in the corner,
opened it, and pulled out a dress. It was a drab, grey thing,
coarse-woven, the uniform of a charwoman or a factory girl. She tossed
it to me. “Put this on. Your coat goes in the stove. The case goes under
the cot. You will stay here, in this room. You will be Marta’s cousin,
Griet, from the country, here to help clean. You have a bad foot. You
say nothing unless spoken to, and then you mumble. You understand?”</p>
<p>I looked from the dress to her implacable face. She was right. To
move as I was, was to paint a target on my back. I had to become
invisible. I had to become no one.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Good.” She turned to leave. “I will bring food. And news, if there
is any. The walls in the bend have ears, but they also have mouths.”</p>
<p>She slipped back through the sacking curtain, leaving me alone.</p>
<p>I stripped off my coat, my fingers lingering on the pocket where the
manifests lay. I transferred them to the waistband of my trousers. Then
I fed my coat, piece by piece, into the hungry little stove. The wool
smoldered, then caught, the smell of damp and fryer grease giving way to
acrid smoke. I watched it burn. It felt like watching a skin being
shed.</p>
<p>I put on the dress. It was rough against my skin, smelling of lye and
a stranger’s sweat. It hung on me, shapeless and anonymous. I bundled my
own clothes and shoved them under the cot with the case. I sat back
down. I was Griet. A girl with a bad foot. A nobody.</p>
<p>The act of stillness was a new kind of agony. My mind raced, circling
the warehouse, the gunshots, the older man’s words. <em>She is a
message.</em> A message to Van Houten? A declaration that his quiet,
surgical game was discovered? Or a message <em>from</em> Van Houten, a
warning to someone else that had gone awry, with me as the unintended
courier?</p>
<p>The syringes. They were the key. A product. Something to be shipped,
distributed. Bought and sold. Or administered.</p>
<p>Marta returned with a bowl of thin stew and a hunk of black bread.
She set it on the chair. “Eat.” She stood, listening to the murmur from
the outer room. “They are talking. The word is on the water. There was a
shooting at the old Van Houten warehouse on the commercial dock. Two men
injured. A woman seen fleeing. The city watch is asking questions, but
quietly. Too quietly. Van Houten’s men are asking louder. They are
offering guilders for information. A lot of guilders.”</p>
<p>“What are they saying about the woman?”</p>
<p>“That she is a thief. That she took something valuable. They are not
saying what.” Her eyes narrowed. “But they are saying she is dangerous.
Armed. A known associate of… unsavory elements.”</p>
<p>A laugh, harsh and dry, escaped my throat. “They’re building the
gallows before they’ve caught the fox.”</p>
<p>“They are telling a story,” Marta corrected, her voice low. “And in
their story, you are the villain. This makes things simple for everyone.
The watch can look busy. Van Houten can get his property back. And the
woman… the woman can be found floating in the river, a tragic end to a
life of crime. A closed case.” She looked at the bowl. “Eat, Griet. You
will need your strength.”</p>
<p>She left again. I forced the stew down. It was tasteless, but it was
hot. The simple act of eating, of being still, of wearing another
woman’s skin, began to dull the sharp edge of panic. It was replaced by
a cold, focused clarity.</p>
<p>I was in a box. The only way out was to change the story.</p>
<p>To do that, I needed to know what the syringes were. And I needed to
tell my story to someone who could not afford to let Van Houten’s story
stand.</p>
<p>Jan. At De Visser. He was a neutral ground, a repository of secrets.
He heard everything. And he had his own codes, his own loyalties that
sometimes ran counter to the men with florid signatures. He was also the
only link I had to the man who had started all this—the client who had
hired me to find the missing girl, the case that had led me to the
warehouse. A client who had given me a name that now felt like a set-up:
<em>De Vries</em>. A name that had led me to a warehouse full of Van
Houten’s men.</p>
<p>I needed to know if Jan had set the snare, or if he was just another
piece on the board.</p>
<p>But to get to Jan, I had to get out of the river bend. And to do
that, I had to move before the hunt solidified at dawn.</p>
<p>I waited an hour. The murmur in the outer room died down. The single
bulb beyond the sacking went out. Silence settled, broken only by the
drip of the gutter and the occasional creak of the old building. I
pulled my own clothes from under the cot. They were still damp, but they
were mine. I changed back into them, the familiar weight a small
comfort. I kept the bandage on my ankle. I retrieved the case.</p>
<p>I pushed through the sacking curtain. The main room was dark, empty
except for Pieter, asleep on a pallet behind the bar. Marta sat at a
table by the dead stove, a single candle guttering beside her. She was
not asleep. She was waiting.</p>
<p>“I’m going,” I said, my voice a whisper in the dark.</p>
<p>“I know.” She did not look at me. “The debt is paid.”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“There is a way. Through the old tannery vats. It comes out in the
sewer tunnel under Brouwersstraat. It is not pleasant. But it is not
watched.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Thank you, Marta.”</p>
<p>“Do not thank me. Just go. And if you are caught, you found that way
yourself. You are a thief. I am a widow who runs a poor <em>kroeg</em>.
We have never met.”</p>
<p>It was the only kindness left she could offer. I took it.</p>
<p>She led me through a low arch behind the bar, into a space that
smelled of earth and ancient, rotten chemicals. She pointed to a rusted
iron hatch in the floor, half-hidden by sacks. “Down. Follow the tunnel.
It slopes up. The grate at the end is loose.”</p>
<p>I lifted the hatch. A smell of stagnation and decay rose up, thick
enough to taste. I looked back at Marta. Her face in the candlelight was
a stone mask.</p>
<p>I descended into the blackness.</p>
<p>The tunnel was a tube of slick brick, barely wide enough for my
shoulders. I had to hunch, the case scraping against the wall. The
darkness was absolute, a physical pressure. I moved by feel, one hand on
the cold, wet wall, my bad foot dragging. The sound of my own breathing
was deafening. Time lost meaning. There was only the slow, painful
shuffle forward, the occasional skitter of something in the muck
underfoot, and the crushing weight of the earth above.</p>
<p>Just as the air began to feel slightly less foul, a faint, grey light
appeared ahead. The tunnel ended in a vertical shaft, with iron rungs
set into the wall. Above, a circular grate. Street light filtered down,
diluted by fog. I climbed, each rung a trial for my ankle. I pushed at
the grate. It shifted, then gave with a screech of rust.</p>
<p>I emerged into a narrow service alley behind the breweries on
Brouwersstraat. The smell of hops and yeast was a sweet relief after the
tunnel. It was the dead hour, just before the first stirrings of the
city’s morning. The sky was a deep, bruised grey.</p>
<p>I was on the wrong side of the river bend, closer to the commercial
district. De Visser was a twenty-minute walk for a healthy person. For
me, it would be an hour of agony and exposure.</p>
<p>I had no choice. I pulled my collar up, gripped the case, and began
to walk.</p>
<p>The city in this hour was a ghost of itself. Delivery carts began to
clatter over cobbles. A lone barge hooted on the river. Lights came on
in upper-story windows. I kept my head down, my pace steady, my limp a
part of my disguise—just another worker heading for an early shift. I
avoided the main thoroughfares, sticking to the service lanes and back
streets. Twice I saw pairs of city watchmen, but they were hunched
against the damp, their minds on their own discomfort, not on a lone,
limping woman.</p>
<p>As I neared the old district where De Visser sat, the character of
the streets changed. The buildings grew more cramped, the smells more
familiar. I was getting close. And so was the danger.</p>
<p>I turned the corner onto the canal where De Visser stood. The usual
yellow glow from its windows was absent. The door was closed. It was too
early, even for Jan’s early clients.</p>
<p>I approached from the opposite side of the canal, using the bridge
for cover. I watched the door. Nothing moved. The whole street was
quiet, sleeping off the night.</p>
<p>It was too quiet.</p>
<p>A prickle, the old instinct, ran up my spine. The silence had a
quality to it. A held breath. I looked at the windows above the bar.
Jan’s living quarters. Dark.</p>
<p>My eyes scanned the street. A delivery van parked too neatly
opposite. The curtain in a first-floor window across the way, drawn but
twitching. A man leaning in a doorway down the street, pretending to
read a newspaper in the pre-dawn gloom.</p>
<p>They were here. They had anticipated me. They had drawn a circle
around the only hole I had left.</p>
<p>Jan was either inside, a prisoner, or he was part of the circle.
Either way, De Visser was a trap.</p>
<p>I stood frozen on the bridge, the case heavy in my hand. The sky was
lightening from grey to a sickly yellow. The net was here. It had been
re-knit, stronger than before. And I was standing in the open, holding
the very thing it was designed to catch.</p>
<p>I had no hole left. No alias. No door.</p>
<p>The man in the doorway folded his newspaper. He looked up. His eyes
met mine across the distance.</p>
<p>He knew.</p>
<p>I turned and limped, as fast as I could, back the way I had come.
Behind me, I heard a low whistle. Then the sound of boots on cobbles,
starting at a walk, then breaking into a run.</p>
<p>The hunt was no longer quiet. It was here. It was now. And it had my
scent.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-17-1"><strong>Chapter 17</strong></h2>
<p>The run was a jagged, lurching thing. My leg was a column of hot
gravel, each impact sending a fresh shock up into my hip. The case
slapped against my thigh, a stupid, clumsy weight. The sound of boots
behind me was a spreading stain on the quiet street, not a single set
but multiple, converging. They had been waiting in a ring. I had walked
into the centre of it, a mouse sniffing at the cheese.</p>
<p>I didn’t look back. Looking back was for prey that had time for
regret. I cut left into an alley so narrow my shoulders brushed the damp
brick on either side. It was a gutter, not a street, choked with the
reek of rotting vegetables and urine. The boots echoed at the mouth,
then slowed. They wouldn’t come in single file. They’d send two, hold
the rest at the ends. Professional.</p>
<p>Ahead, the alley T-junctioned. Right led back towards the wider
canals, towards light and more of them. Left dove deeper into the old
quarter, a labyrinth of leaning houses and enclosed courtyards. I went
left, my breath sawing in my throat. The sky above the rooftops was the
colour of a bruise, yellow at the edges, purple at the heart.</p>
<p>I heard a shout, answered from a parallel street. They were
communicating, tightening the cordon. They weren’t chasing. They were
herding.</p>
<p>The thought was a cold stone in my gut. I was moving, but I wasn’t
choosing. My path was being shaped by their presence, funneled. I needed
a door. A crack. Something they hadn’t bought or boarded up.</p>
<p>I burst out of the alley into a small courtyard, a forgotten space
between three tall gables. A single gas lamp flickered, useless in the
gathering dawn. A woman was drawing water from a shared pump, her back
to me. She turned at the sound of my footsteps, her eyes widening at the
sight of me—a wild thing, bleeding panic. She didn’t scream. She just
took a slow step back, her grip tightening on the handle of her bucket.
A judgement passed in that silence: I was trouble. Women’s trouble. The
kind that drew the eyes of men with boots and whistles. Her face closed,
a shutter slamming down. She would not help. She would point, later,
when they asked.</p>
<p>There was a low archway across the court. I made for it. As I passed
the pump, I saw my reflection in the dark water of her bucket—a pale,
sharp mask, hair plastered to my skull, eyes like holes. No wonder she
stepped back.</p>
<p>The archway led to a covered passage, then out onto another canal.
Not my canal. A quieter, poorer one. The houses here had wooden
galleries stacked above the water, laundry hanging limp in the damp air.
I pressed myself into a doorway, the wood rough and splintered against
my back. I listened.</p>
<p>Boots, to the north. A steady, walking pace. To the south, silence,
but it was the wrong kind of silence. The birds had stopped. I was in a
pocket. The net was drawing closed.</p>
<p>I looked at the case in my hand. The stupid, damned case. It was the
key to the lock, and the lock was my own neck. I had two choices: drop
it, or keep it. Dropping it might make me less interesting. But they had
seen me with it. They knew I valued it. A woman running empty-handed was
just a woman running. A woman clutching a thing, a prize, was a story.
They would want the story. They would peel it from me.</p>
<p>So I kept it.</p>
<p>My eyes scanned the opposite side of the canal. The galleries. A
memory, old and dusty, surfaced. Years back, a job for a ship’s chandler
who liked to beat his wife. She’d paid me in information, not coin, her
voice a whisper in a tavern even rougher than De Visser. She’d mentioned
a place, a bolt-hole used by girls who needed to disappear from men for
a night or a week. A widow, she’d said. Above a cooper’s yard. The widow
took no money, only asked you work for your keep. Mending nets.
Scrubbing floors. A woman’s economy.</p>
<p>I tried to picture the chandler’s wife’s face, but all I could see
was the fear in it, and the map she’d drawn in spilled beer. Two bridges
down. A yard with a blue door. A green-shuttered window on the top
floor.</p>
<p>It was a thread. The only one I had.</p>
<p>I moved, keeping to the shadows beneath the galleries. The sound of
the boots was closer now, a coordinated sweep. They’d be checking
doorways, questioning the early risers. A man stepping out to smoke
would be shown a badge, leaned on. <em>A woman. Have you seen her?</em>
The description would be accurate. They’d have it from the man on the
bridge.</p>
<p>I found the second bridge—a narrow, hump-backed stone affair. I
didn’t cross it. I went under it, into the cold, dripping dark where the
water lapped against slimy steps. On the other side, I climbed back up
to street level. There. A narrow passage between two houses, leading to
a courtyard. And a blue door, faded and peeling.</p>
<p>The cooper’s yard was silent, stacked with barrels and the sweet
smell of fresh-cut wood. A light was on in a ground-floor workshop. I
ignored it. My eyes went to the top floor of the house attached to the
yard. A green shutter, closed.</p>
<p>No time for stealth. I went to the side door of the house, a
servant’s entrance. I tried the handle. Locked. I knocked, three sharp
raps. Nothing. I knocked again, harder.</p>
<p>A shadow passed across the crack of light under the door. It stopped.
They were listening.</p>
<p>“Marta sent me,” I hissed, the name of the chandler’s wife feeling
like a lie on my tongue. “The nets need mending.”</p>
<p>A long pause. Then the sound of a heavy bolt being drawn back. The
door opened a hand’s width. An eye, pale and deeply lined, peered out.
It took me in—the damp coat, the wild hair, the case, the fear that
clung to me like a smell. The eye didn’t widen. It just assessed.</p>
<p>“Marta’s dead,” the woman said, her voice a dry rustle. “Five years
now.”</p>
<p>My heart sank. The thread snapped.</p>
<p>“But the nets still need mending,” the woman said. She opened the
door wider. She was small, bent, wrapped in a shawl that had once been
black. Her face was a net of wrinkles, but her gaze was clear and hard
as river stone. “Come in. Quickly.”</p>
<p>I slipped inside. She bolted the door behind me, then turned. She
didn’t ask my name. She looked at my leg. “You’re bleeding through your
trousers.”</p>
<p>“It’s old.”</p>
<p>“It’s fresh.” She pointed a knotted finger at the case. “That the
trouble?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Not money?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She nodded, as if this confirmed something. “Men chasing a woman for
something that isn’t money are the worst kind. Come upstairs. Don’t drip
on my floor.”</p>
<p>I followed her up a narrow, steep staircase that groaned with every
step. The house was clean but poor, smelling of soap and boiled cabbage.
The top floor was a single, low-ceilinged room under the eaves, sparsely
furnished: a cot, a chair, a washstand, a small stove. The green shutter
was on the far wall.</p>
<p>“You have until full light,” she said, standing in the doorway.
“They’ll do a house-to-house then. I can’t stop them. I can say I’ve
seen nothing. They might believe an old woman. They might not.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t thank me. The floor needs scrubbing. The pots downstairs need
scouring. You’ll earn the hour.” She turned to go, then paused. “There’s
a loose board under the cot. If that thing needs to not be found for a
minute. It’s not deep.”</p>
<p>Then she was gone, her footsteps a soft shuffle on the stairs.</p>
<p>I stood in the centre of the room, the adrenaline leaching away,
leaving me hollow and shaking. I listened. The yard outside was still
quiet. But the city was waking up. Carts began to rumble on distant
streets. A baby cried in a neighbouring house.</p>
<p>I looked at the case. I set it on the cot and opened the clasps. The
metal was cold. Inside, nestled in grey felt, lay the device. It was all
clean lines and polished brass, a series of interlocking cylinders and
delicate gears. It looked like a scientific instrument, something for
measuring stars or pressure. It looked innocent. It was not.</p>
<p>I had stolen it from a man who thought it was a key to fortune. He
was wrong. It was a key to a different kind of lock. A theoretical one.
A man at the university, a man with soft hands and a mind like a razor,
had explained it to me in a room that smelled of dust and desperation.
He called it a predictive regulator. Feed it data—tides, cargo
manifests, telegraph traffic—and its gears would turn, its needles would
quiver, and it would spit out a probability. A ship leaving on a certain
day would meet bad weather. A certain stock would fall. A certain
official would be vulnerable to blackmail on a certain date. It was a
machine for seeing the weak points in the world’s weave.</p>
<p>The man with soft hands had wanted it destroyed. The man I stole it
from wanted to sell it to the highest bidder. I had taken it for the
money, and because the soft-handed man had looked at me not with lust or
contempt, but with a kind of shared, grim understanding. <em>This should
not exist,</em> he’d said. <em>Some threads are not meant to be
pulled.</em></p>
<p>Now the highest bidders were at the door. And they weren’t commercial
interests. The precision of the net, the patience of it, the way they
had taken De Visser without a sound—this was state work. The city’s own
shadows had come to life.</p>
<p>I needed a new plan. I had an hour.</p>
<p>I lifted the loose board under the cot. A shallow space, just as
she’d said, smelling of dust and old wood. I placed the case inside,
closed the board, and dragged the cot back over it. It wouldn’t fool a
proper search, but it would buy a moment of confusion.</p>
<p>Then I went downstairs. The old woman—she never gave me her name—was
in the small, dark kitchen, a pile of blackened pots at her feet. She
handed me a brush and a bucket of sand and lye. “Scour.”</p>
<p>I got on my knees. The work was mindless, brutal. The sand scraped my
knuckles raw. The chemical smell bit my nostrils. But it was real. It
grounded me. The old woman sat in a chair by the cold hearth, knitting
something grey and endless, her needles clicking a steady, metronomic
rhythm. She didn’t watch me work. She just let me exist in her space, a
temporary problem to be managed.</p>
<p>“They’ll offer money,” she said, after a long silence broken only by
the scrape of sand on iron. “For information. They’ll lean on the weak
ones. The drunks. The debtors. The ones with secrets.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“You have people? Anyone they can lean on?”</p>
<p>I thought of Jan. His face, impassive behind the bar. A prisoner or a
participant. Either way, he was a pressure point. I thought of the few
others who knew my face, my trade. Ghosts, all of them. But ghosts could
be summoned, given form by the right threats.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. But it was a lie. There was always someone.</p>
<p>“Good,” she said, though I knew she didn’t believe me. “A woman alone
is harder to crack. They have to find you first.”</p>
<p>I finished the last pot, my hands red and stinging. The light at the
small window was stronger now, a flat, grey daylight. The hour was
up.</p>
<p>As if on cue, a firm knock sounded at the front door. Not the side
door. The official entrance.</p>
<p>The clicking of the knitting needles stopped. The old woman looked at
me. “Attic. Now. Don’t make a sound.”</p>
<p>I moved, silent and fast, back up the groaning stairs. I didn’t go
into the attic room. I stood on the small landing, pressed against the
wall, listening.</p>
<p>I heard her shuffle to the door. Heard the bolt slide. Heard a man’s
voice, polite, firm. City accent, but educated. Not a street-thug’s
growl.</p>
<p>“Good morning, madam. Apologies for the early hour. City security.
We’re inquiring after a person of interest. May we come in?”</p>
<p>“We?”</p>
<p>“Myself and my colleague.”</p>
<p>A pause. I imagined her blocking the doorway with her small, bent
frame. “What person?”</p>
<p>“A woman. Late twenties. Dark hair. Possibly injured. She may be
carrying a case.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen no one. I’m an old woman. I sleep poorly, but I don’t
wander.”</p>
<p>“Of course. But we must check, for your safety as well. She is
considered dangerous.”</p>
<p>A soft, dry laugh. “More dangerous than two large men in my hallway?
I doubt it. But check. Be quick. I have bread in the oven.”</p>
<p>Boots on the floorboards. Two pairs. They moved through the ground
floor, opening doors. The kitchen. The workshop. Their steps were
methodical, unhurried. They knew their business.</p>
<p>Then the stairs. They creaked under their weight. I shrank back, my
hand going to the knife at my belt. It was a pathetic gesture. If they
came up here, it was over.</p>
<p>They reached the first-floor landing. I heard a door open. A bedroom.
Then another.</p>
<p>“What’s up here?” the polite voice asked.</p>
<p>“The attic. Storage. Leaks when it rains. Mind the third step, it’s
loose.”</p>
<p>The third step groaned, loud and plaintive. One of them swore
softly.</p>
<p>They were on the small landing. I was around the corner, in the dark
of the attic room doorway. I held my breath.</p>
<p>The door to the attic room opened. I could see the slice of light
from the window fall into the hall. I could hear them moving inside, a
floorboard groaning.</p>
<p>“Empty,” a second voice said, younger, terser.</p>
<p>“Check the space.”</p>
<p>A moment of silence. Then the sound of the cot being dragged. My
muscles coiled. They’d found it.</p>
<p>But the younger voice just said, “Nothing. Dust and old linen.”</p>
<p>They hadn’t lifted the board. They’d looked under the cot, seen
nothing, and moved on. The old woman’s trick had worked. For now.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your cooperation, madam,” the polite voice said from
downstairs. They were leaving. “If you see anything, you’ll contact the
watch house on Koningstraat.”</p>
<p>The door closed. The bolt slid home.</p>
<p>I didn’t move. I waited, counting my heartbeats. After a full minute,
I heard the old woman’s steps on the stairs again. She appeared on the
landing, her face expressionless.</p>
<p>“They’re gone. For now. They’ll watch the streets. They’ll have
someone on the bridges.”</p>
<p>“I need to get to the river,” I said. The words were out before I’d
fully thought them. The river was chaos. Barges, tugs, fishermen,
smugglers. It was a different city, with its own rules. It was the only
place wide enough to swallow me.</p>
<p>“The river is two kilometres away,” she said. “Through their
net.”</p>
<p>“I can’t stay here.”</p>
<p>“No.” She looked at my clothes. “You need to look like you belong.
You need a reason to be moving at this hour.”</p>
<p>She went back downstairs. I followed. She went to a chest in the
corner of the kitchen and pulled out a bundle of rough, grey cloth. She
tossed it to me. It was a dress, plain and shapeless, and a stained
apron. “Fish-gutter’s shift. Put it on. There’s a basket by the door.
Take it. Go to the market at Sint Jansplein. It’s in the opposite
direction of the river. Walk with purpose. Head down. If they stop you,
you’re Griet, fetching her mistress’s order from the fishmonger. The
mistress is Frau Vanderzee, three houses down. She’s deaf and mean.
They’ll get nothing from her.”</p>
<p>I changed in the kitchen, turning my back to her. My own clothes,
still damp, went into the basket under a scrap of cloth. The dress
smelled of salt and blood. It was coarse against my skin. I tied the
apron, tucking my knife into the waistband. I looked at myself in the
dark glass of the window. A working woman. Invisible.</p>
<p>“The case,” I said.</p>
<p>“Leave it. You can’t carry it. It’s what they want. It’s what they’ll
see.”</p>
<p>“I have to take it.”</p>
<p>Her old eyes hardened. “Then you’re a fool. And you’ll be caught by
noon. That thing is a man’s trouble. Let it go.”</p>
<p>She was right. It was the logical move. Shed the weight, become a
ghost. But the case was the only leverage I had left. It was the only
thing between me and total helplessness. Without it, I was just a woman
they wanted to silence. With it, I was a problem they had to solve.</p>
<p>“I’ll come back for it,” I said.</p>
<p>She didn’t answer. She just shook her head, a small, final motion.
She knew I wouldn’t.</p>
<p>I took the basket and went to the side door. She unbolted it.</p>
<p>“The river,” she said. “You won’t get there by running. You get there
by being someone else. Remember that.”</p>
<p>I stepped out into the courtyard. The light was full now, a damp,
grey morning. I could hear the city properly awake. I adjusted the
basket on my arm, felt the weight of my clothes hidden within it, the
heavier weight of the choice I’d made. I lowered my head, slumped my
shoulders into the weary slope of a domestic, and walked out into the
street.</p>
<p>I turned towards Sint Jansplein, away from the water. I walked at the
pace of drudgery, not flight. A cart rumbled past. A shopkeeper was
taking down his shutters. I saw two men in long coats standing at the
corner where my alley met the wider street. They were scanning faces.
One of them glanced at me. His eyes passed over the dress, the apron,
the basket, the downturned face. They moved on, looking for a limping
woman in a wet coat, clutching a case.</p>
<p>I passed within three metres of them. The smell of their cheap
tobacco cut through the morning air. I kept walking, my heart a hammer
against my ribs. I didn’t look up. I was Griet. I had pots to scour and
fish to fetch.</p>
<p>I turned the corner, putting them behind me. The market square opened
up ahead, a cacophony of shouts and bartering, a crush of bodies.
Safety, of a kind. I melted into the crowd, becoming one more grey shape
in the morning throng.</p>
<p>But as I stood at a stall, pretending to examine a mackerel, I looked
back the way I had come. The two men were still at the corner. They
weren’t leaving. They were setting up a watch. They knew I was in the
area. They were patient. They would wait, and watch, and question every
woman of my general build who passed through their filter.</p>
<p>The net hadn’t been broken. It had just been refined. They were no
longer chasing. They were sieving.</p>
<p>And I was in the sieve, dressed as a piece of grit, with the river
shining like a mirage two kilometres to the west. I had traded a sprint
for a slow, perilous filtration. I had the disguise. I had the
direction.</p>
<p>But I had left the key to my freedom under a loose board in an old
woman’s attic. And I knew, with a cold certainty that settled in my
bones, that I would have to go back for it. The machine was my only coin
in a world that traded only in power. Without it, I was just another
woman trying to escape the grip of men who had decided she was in the
way.</p>
<p>The hunt was no longer a chase. It was a waiting game. And I had just
walked onto their board.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-18-1"><strong>Chapter 18</strong></h2>
<p>The market’s noise was a wool blanket, thick and smothering. It
pressed against my ears, a wall of shouted prices and complaints and the
wet slap of fish on marble slabs. I stood at the stall, the mackerel’s
dead eye staring up at me, its scales dull in the grey light. My own
reflection wavered in the film of its pupil: a pinched face under a
linen cap, a stranger’s fear. Griet’s fear. I let my fingers, red and
chapped from the canal water, brush the fish’s cold flank. A performance
of consideration. A housewife’s deliberation.</p>
<p>All the while, my blood sang a single, shrill note: <em>they are
still there</em>.</p>
<p>I had outrun the dogs, but the hunters had simply closed the gate.
They were leaning against the brickwork of the bakery now, the two long
coats. They had lit fresh cigarettes, the smoke a pale grey signal
against the damp air. They were settled. This was no longer pursuit; it
was a shift. One watched the mouth of my alley. The other let his gaze
drift over the crowd, a slow, mechanical sweep. They had all day. They
had the authority to stop any woman who fit the silhouette of their
suspicion. My disguise was my cage. To run now would be to paint a
target on my back. To stay was to let the sieve shake me slowly,
inevitably, into their hands.</p>
<p>The fishmonger, a woman with forearms like dock ropes and a face
carved from salt, narrowed her eyes at me. “You going to buy that or
pray over it?”</p>
<p>I flinched, the Griet in me rising to the surface with a practised
cower. “Sorry. It’s… the price.”</p>
<p>She snorted, turning to shout at a boy lugging a crate of mussels.
The moment broke. I stepped back, melting into the eddy of bodies. The
basket on my arm was an anchor, pulling me down into the role. I moved
with the current of the crowd, letting it carry me deeper into the
square, away from the western edge where the river lay, away from the
men. Every step was a betrayal of my need. The machine called from its
hiding place like a second heartbeat, a dull, insistent throb of loss
beneath my ribs.</p>
<p>I needed a different kind of currency. The kind Jan traded in at
<em>De Visser</em>: information, favour, the subtle leverage of a debt.
But Jan was across the city, and the only capital I had here was the
fiction of Griet, and the few coins in the pocket of this dead woman’s
dress.</p>
<p>I bought a loaf of black bread. I bought two withered turnips. Each
transaction was a stitch in the tapestry of my cover. I spoke in the
flat, clipped tones of the district, my head bowed. I became a moving
part of the market’s machinery, a cog greased with mundane worry. I saw
other women like me—or like Griet—their faces closed as shutters, their
movements economical. They navigated the press of bodies with a weary
expertise, a silent sisterhood of labour. We were ghosts in plain sight,
seen only for our function: to buy, to cook, to clean, to birth. To be
sieved from the world of consequence.</p>
<p>A hand closed around my upper arm.</p>
<p>It was not a rough grip, but it was absolute. The fingers, thick and
strong, pressed through the wool of my sleeve. My heart stopped, then
slammed against my breastbone like a bird in a chimney. I did not look
up. I became a stone. A piece of grit.</p>
<p>“You. Girl.”</p>
<p>The voice was a man’s, bored, official. It came from above and to my
left. I made my eyes wide and blank, turning my head just enough. It was
one of the long coats. His partner was still at the corner, a sentry
against the brick. This one had waded into the stream to pluck out a
likely piece of flotsam. Me.</p>
<p>“Meneer?” I let my voice go thin, reedy.</p>
<p>His face was long, sallow. He had the eyes of a clerk, not a thug;
this was worse. This was procedure. “Where do you live?”</p>
<p>“Kuipersteeg, meneer. Number five.” The lie was ready, a flat on the
other side of the square, not near my alley.</p>
<p>“What’s in the basket?”</p>
<p>I showed him. Bread. Turnips. The mackerel I had not bought. He poked
at them with a gloved finger.</p>
<p>“You’re out early.”</p>
<p>“The master likes his breakfast by seven, meneer.” I kept my gaze on
the second button of his coat. Subservient. Uninteresting.</p>
<p>“See a woman running this way? Earlier. Limping. Looked… out of
place.”</p>
<p>I allowed a flicker of confusion to cross my face. A servant’s
comprehension was slow, carefully doled out. “Running, meneer? No. Only
the fish carts. And the boys.” I risked a glance up, then quickly down.
“Is there trouble?”</p>
<p>He studied me. His look was not of suspicion, but of assessment. Was
I worth more questions? Was my face the one on the leaflet in his
pocket? I felt the weight of the disguise like a suit of lead. He was
not seeing <em>me</em>. He was seeing class, gender, utility. He was
deciding if this particular tool was the one he needed.</p>
<p>A shout went up from a cheese stall—an argument over weight. The
market’s noise, which had dampened around us, surged back. His partner
at the corner gestured impatiently. Their net was wide; I was one small
fish. The calculus of his boredom tipped.</p>
<p>He released my arm. “Move along. Don’t dawdle.”</p>
<p>“Yes, meneer.” I bobbed my head, a shallow, instinctive dip, and
scurried into the thicker crowd, my basket clutched tight. The heat of
shame that flooded me was not Griet’s. It was mine. The performance had
been perfect because it was not a performance at all. It was a language
he expected me to speak, and I had spoken it fluently. I had traded on
my own invisibility. It had saved my skin and hollowed out my chest.</p>
<p>I did not stop shaking until I was three streets over, in the lee of
a chandlery, the smell of tar and rope a solid thing in the air. I
leaned against the wet brick, breathing hard. The false victory of my
escape curdled in my gut. I had not outsmarted them. I had merely
conformed, perfectly, to the narrow channel they allowed for women like
me. The disguise worked because it was a prison they recognised.</p>
<p>The machine. It was the only thing that ever made a space for me that
was my own. A space of gears and pressure, of cause and effect I
controlled. It was a man’s world, that world of mechanics, but within
the cradle of its logic, my hands were the only ones that mattered.
Without it, I was back in the sieve. Griet. Els. Names for the same
commodity.</p>
<p>I had to go back.</p>
<p>The logic was as cold and clean as a steel bearing. The attic room
was in the heart of the area they were watching. They would be looking
for someone fleeing, not returning. They would be looking for a limping
woman in a coat, not a maid with a basket, finishing her marketing. The
old woman, Mrs. de Wit—she was a variable. Had they questioned her?
Would she give me up for a guilder? Or was her solitude its own kind of
fortress?</p>
<p>I had no other move. The river was a taunt. Freedom was a locked
door, and the key was under a warped floorboard in a room that smelled
of dust and mothballs.</p>
<p>I spent the day in a purgatory of slow movement. I walked the
perimeter of their net, a rat learning the dimensions of its trap. I saw
them stop two other women. One, older, they let go quickly. The second,
younger, closer to my build, they questioned at length. I watched from
the doorway of a haberdashery, my face half-hidden by a row of hanging
aprons. I saw the woman’s shoulders hunch, her hands twist. She had
nothing to tell them. Her fear was answer enough. They let her go, but
the message was etched in the air: <em>we can do this. All day. To any
of you.</em></p>
<p>The afternoon bled into a damp, early twilight. The market packed
away. The shopkeepers pulled their shutters closed. The long coats were
replaced by two others, a changing of the guard. The sieve remained.</p>
<p>This was my window. The dogged patience of the day shift would be at
its lowest ebb. The night shift would be fresh, their eyes sharper for
movement in the growing dark. But the transition itself was a moment of
blurred responsibility.</p>
<p>I emptied my basket of its pathetic provisions behind a rain barrel.
The bread, the turnips. I kept the shawl. My heart was a cold, hard
knot. I was not returning to hide. I was returning to steal back a piece
of myself.</p>
<p>The alley, when I turned into it, was a canyon of shadows. The few
windows were already glowing yellow, curtains drawn. I walked with
Griet’s tired trudge, head down, a servant returning from an errand. The
sound of my own footsteps was too loud. I passed the doorway where I’d
slept. I passed the pump. The silence was a held breath.</p>
<p>The door to Mrs. de Wit’s building was unlocked. The stairwell was
dark, smelling of cabbage and mildew. I climbed, each creak of the wood
a thunderclap in the hush. On her landing, I paused. No light showed
under her door. No sound came from within.</p>
<p>My attic door was as I’d left it. I slipped inside, into the absolute
black. I stood for a full minute, listening to the blood roar in my
ears, waiting for a footstep on the stair, for the old woman’s cough.
Nothing.</p>
<p>I crossed to the far wall on my knees, my hands sweeping the rough
planks. My fingers found the familiar warp, the nail head. I pried it
up.</p>
<p>The emptiness beneath was a physical shock.</p>
<p>I plunged my hand into the space, sweeping it left, right. Dust.
Splinters. Nothing. My breath hitched. I felt along the adjacent board,
pried it up too. More nothing.</p>
<p>A cold deeper than the canal water seeped into my bones. She had
found it. Mrs. de Wit. While I was playing Griet in the market, she had
been up here, prying up my floorboards.</p>
<p>The loss was so total it felt like a vacuum. I knelt in the dark, my
hands flat on the empty hole. The machine. My designs. The only proof
that I was more than the world’s grit. Gone.</p>
<p>A floorboard creaked behind me.</p>
<p>I froze. The door was still closed. The sound had come from within
the room.</p>
<p>“I wondered when you’d come back.” The voice was Mrs. de Wit’s, but
stripped of its quaver. It was dry, precise. A click, and the warm glow
of an oil lamp flooded the attic. She stood by the dormer window, a
shape in a dark dress, the lamp in her hand. Her eyes were not the
milky, vague things I remembered. They were sharp, and they held me
pinned.</p>
<p>“You took it,” I said. My voice was flat. Dead.</p>
<p>“It’s safe,” she said. She didn’t move. “A remarkable piece of work.
The tolerances. The spring mechanism. It’s not a locksmith’s tool. It’s
a musician’s instrument.”</p>
<p>She understood it. The realisation was a second blow.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” I asked, still on my knees. The power balance had
not just shifted; it had inverted. She was the holder of my soul. I was
the supplicant.</p>
<p>“I want to know who you are,” she said. “The men at the corner are
city watch, but the questions they’re asking… they’re not for a petty
thief. They’re for someone who has offended a powerful man. The machine
offends in a particular way. It is a key to places you are not meant to
go.”</p>
<p>I said nothing. The silence stretched. She took a step forward, the
lamplight carving deep gullies in her ancient face.</p>
<p>“My husband was a clockmaker,” she said, her gaze drifting to the
window, to the darkening sky. “A genius with tiny things. He made a
singing bird for the daughter of a burgomaster. A masterpiece. They paid
him in praise and a pittance. When he asked for what it was worth, they
laughed. They broke his hands with a hammer so he could not make another
for their rivals. He spent the last twenty years of his life watching
his own genius leak away into pain and regret.” Her eyes snapped back to
mine. “I know the smell of a man who fears a clever thing in the wrong
hands. Who is he?”</p>
<p>“Visser,” I whispered. The name was ash in my mouth. “Hendrik
Visser.”</p>
<p>A slow nod. “The shipping magnate. A man who owns doors, and the
right to open them.” She placed the lamp on the floor between us. “So.
You are a woman with a machine that opens doors, and Hendrik Visser
wants you stopped. That makes you either the greatest fool in the city,
or the only interesting person to have darkened my doorstep in a
decade.”</p>
<p>“I need it back,” I said, the plea naked in my voice.</p>
<p>“Why? To run? They will catch you. A woman alone, with a singular
tool… you are a beacon. You have already learned you cannot run as a
woman. You can only… dissipate.” She gestured to my Griet clothes. “That
is a slow death.”</p>
<p>“What choice do I have?”</p>
<p>She smiled then, a thin, papery thing. “You stop being the grit in
the sieve. You become the hand that shakes it.” She bent, with a
stiffness that was not feigned, and from the shadows by her feet, she
lifted the leather case. My case. She held it out. “Take it.”</p>
<p>I stared, unmoving. It was a trick. It had to be.</p>
<p>“Your design has a flaw,” she said, her voice clinical now. “The
third actuator spring. It’s under too much tension. It will fatigue,
then snap, at the worst possible moment. My husband’s notes are in the
case. A modification. It will hold.”</p>
<p>I rose, my legs numb. I took the case. The familiar weight was a
shock of warmth. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Because Visser broke my husband’s hands,” she said, her voice like
iron filings. “And I am too old to break his neck. But you… you have the
key to his doors. And I have just given you the means to turn it in the
lock without it breaking in your hand.” She stepped closer, her sharp
eyes boring into mine. “Running is what they expect. It is the woman’s
option. Hiding is what they expect. What they do not expect is for the
mouse to turn and gnaw through the ropes of the winch. To collapse the
trap on the trapper.”</p>
<p>The idea was so vast, so terrifying, it left no room for breath. Not
escape. Not hiding. <em>Attack.</em></p>
<p>“I am one woman,” I breathed.</p>
<p>“You are a woman with a machine that opens anything,” she corrected.
“Visser’s power is built on locks. On vaults. On private rooms and
secured ledgers. On the assumption that what is his stays his. You are a
solvent to that assumption.” She turned back to the window. “The men
outside are looking for a fugitive. Be something else. Be a ghost in his
machine. Be a rumour in his walls. Make him afraid of his own
locks.”</p>
<p>She was handing me not just my tool, but a new direction. A war, not
a flight. The false victory of my escape was truly shattered now, blown
apart not by capture, but by this offer of a different, more terrible
path. The gender dynamics I had used as a shield were now a weapon she
was placing in my hands. They would not look for a saboteur in a maid’s
dress. They would not suspect the quiet, fearful gender of audacity.</p>
<p>“They will hurt you,” I said. “When they find you helped me.”</p>
<p>She did not look back. “Let them try. I have been waiting twenty
years for a reason to make a noise.”</p>
<p>I looked down at the case. It was no longer just my freedom. It was a
weapon. A declaration. I had walked onto their board as a piece to be
captured. Mrs. de Wit was telling me to flip the board and set it on
fire.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, the words utterly inadequate.</p>
<p>“Go out the back,” she said, pointing to a small, hinged panel in the
wall I had never noticed—a servant’s pass-through from a time when the
attic housed live-in help. “It leads to the roof of the washhouse, then
down to the next street. Avoid the sieve.”</p>
<p>I moved to the panel, my mind churning with the seismic shift of it
all. As I pushed it open, letting in a gust of damp, free air, she spoke
once more.</p>
<p>“Els.”</p>
<p>I turned. She had never asked my name.</p>
<p>“Make it sing,” she said.</p>
<p>Then she blew out the lamp, plunging herself, and the attic, and the
ghost of her husband, back into the dark.</p>
<p>I slipped through the opening, onto the steep, wet tiles. The case
was solid in my grip. Below, in the street, I could see the glow of a
watchman’s lantern, a tiny star in the gloom. They were still sieving.
Still waiting for the woman who ran.</p>
<p>I turned my face away from the river, away from the west. I looked
east, towards the old city, where the gabled houses of the wealthy
crowded together, where Hendrik Visser’s offices overlooked his
docks.</p>
<p>The hunt was no longer a waiting game. It was a different game
entirely. And I had just been given the only piece that mattered.</p>
<p>I began to climb down, away from the light, into a different kind of
dark.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-19-1"><strong>Chapter 19</strong></h2>
<p>The dark between the gables was a different substance than the dark
of the attic. It was cold and wet and alive with the drip of
condensation from rusted gutters, the scuttle of rats in the valleys of
the tiles. I moved across the roof of the washhouse, the leather case a
hard, accusing weight against my ribs. The tiles were slick with a film
of city grime, each step a negotiation with gravity. Below, the
watchman’s lantern bobbed, a patient, predatory glow. They were sieving
the streets, but the rooftops of this district were a forgotten lattice,
a world for cats and chimney sweeps and now, for me.</p>
<p>I dropped from the washhouse eaves into a narrow alley that smelled
of wet stone and cat piss. The case thumped against my side. I paused,
listening. The murmur of the search was a street over, the calls of the
watchmen muffled by brick. They were looking for a fugitive, a desperate
creature fleeing west towards the river and the promise of a boat. They
were not looking for a woman walking with purpose east, into the heart
of the merchant belt, carrying a gentleman’s valise.</p>
<p>That was the first lie. The dress was the second.</p>
<p>I found a recessed doorway, deep enough to swallow the light from the
distant streetlamp. My fingers, numb with cold and the aftermath of the
attic’s revelation, worked at the clasps of the case. They opened with a
soft, oiled click. Inside, nestled in fitted velvet, was not a spy’s kit
of lockpicks and poisons, but a uniform. A maid’s uniform, severe and
grey, with a white apron folded crisp as a legal document. Beneath it, a
pair of sensible, low-heeled shoes. At the very bottom, wrapped in a
scrap of silk, was a bone-handled paring knife, its edge honed to a
wicked gleam. A tool, not a weapon. A woman’s instrument.</p>
<p>I shed my own coat, the damp wool reeking of the river and fear. The
cold bit through my blouse. The maid’s dress was coarse, a rough-spun
wool that scratched at my neck and wrists. It was several sizes too
large, meant for a broader, stouter frame. Mrs. de Wit’s frame, twenty
years ago. I used the belt to gather the excess fabric, pulling it tight
until it was merely shapeless, not engulfing. The apron strings I tied
in a precise, efficient bow at the small of my back. The shoes were a
close enough fit. I bundled my own clothes into the case, tucked the
knife into the deep pocket of the apron, and left the case in the
shadowed corner of the doorway. An offering to the alley. A discarded
piece of a previous game.</p>
<p>I stepped out of the alcove.</p>
<p>The transformation was not in the mirror, for there was none. It was
in the space I now occupied in the world. My shoulders, which had been
set in a defensive hunch, now rounded forward naturally, my chin dipping
towards my chest. My stride, which I forced into a long, ground-eating
pace, shortened to quick, efficient steps. The change was not posture
alone. It was a yielding, a making of oneself small within the available
space. I had observed it a thousand times in the women who served at
<em>De Visser</em>, in the scullery maids who darted through the grand
houses like mice. It was an art of invisibility through
expectedness.</p>
<p>I turned onto the broader street. A pair of watchmen, their
greatcoats dark with rain, stood under the eaves of a chandler’s shop.
One held a lantern aloft, its light carving hollows in their faces. I
did not avoid them. I did not meet their eyes. I kept my gaze lowered to
the cobbles three paces ahead, my hands clasped loosely in front of me,
the very picture of a servant on an errand, hurrying home before the
curfew bell. The light washed over me. I felt it like a physical
touch.</p>
<p>“You there,” one called, his voice bored.</p>
<p>I stopped, my body tensing not into flight, but into a respectful,
fearful stillness. I turned my head just enough, keeping my eyes
downcast. “Meneer?”</p>
<p>“Out late. Whose house?”</p>
<p>“Mevrouw van der Linde, meneer. On the Keizersgracht. Sent for more
candles.” My voice was higher, softer, stripped of the gravel I
cultivated at the bar. It was the voice of a girl who expected to be
chastised.</p>
<p>He grunted. “Van der Linde’s lot are always burning midnight oil.
Counting their guilders, I’d wager. Get on with you. Straight home,
mind.”</p>
<p>“Yes, meneer. Thank you, meneer.”</p>
<p>I scurried past, the subservience a sour taste in my mouth. Their
attention, that searching, suspicious beam, had slid right off the grey
wool and the white apron. I was furniture. I was part of the city’s
background noise. The power of it was dizzying, and utterly repellent.
This was the shield. This meekness, this expected fear, was the cloak
that rendered me unseen. Mrs. de Wit had not given me a disguise. She
had given me a social blind spot.</p>
<p>The rain had settled into a persistent drizzle. The grand houses of
the eastern canals were monuments of shadow and gilded light, their
windows glowing behind thick curtains. I knew Hendrik Visser’s house.
Everyone did. It was not the oldest, but it was the most aggressively
maintained, a statement in red brick and white trim that glared across
the water at its rivals. His offices, however, were separate. A merchant
prince did not soil his home with ledgers and the smell of anxious
clerks. His domain was a narrow, four-story building wedged between a
sugar refinery and a shipping insurer’s, overlooking his own docks. It
was a fortress of commerce, and it was where he would be, even at this
hour, on the eve of a major shipment. He would be counting, like van der
Linde, but his count would be of crates and timetables, of profit and
risk.</p>
<p>I approached from the rear, through a service lane choked with
delivery carts and empty barrels. The back of the building was a plain
façade of soot-stained brick, punctuated by a heavy oak door and a line
of high, grimy windows. The ground-floor window was lit. The kitchen, or
a clerk’s late-night pantry. A single window on the third floor also
showed a faint, steady glow. An office. His office.</p>
<p>The lock on the service door was a heavy, iron thing, but it was
oiled for daily use. The paring knife was too light, too short. I needed
a different key. I retreated into the deeper shadows, my mind working. A
maid did not pick locks. A maid had legitimate reasons to be near
doors.</p>
<p>I waited. The drizzle seeped through the coarse wool, finding my
skin. Time stretched, measured in the distant bells of the Westerkerk,
each chime a hammer fall on the city’s quiet. Then, the service door
opened. A young kitchen boy, yawning, shuffled out with a bucket of
slops. He trudged towards a midden heap at the end of the lane, his
shoulders slumped with tiredness.</p>
<p>The door swung shut behind him, but not fully. It caught, perhaps on
a warped floorboard inside, leaving a gap of two inches.</p>
<p>I moved as he emptied his bucket, the sound masking my steps. As he
turned back, rubbing his eyes, I was already at the door, my body angled
as if I had just emerged. I held it open for him, a small, silent
courtesy.</p>
<p>He blinked, surprised to see another servant in the gloom. “Oh.
Thanks.”</p>
<p>I offered a tight, tired smile, the universal language of the
overworked. “Long night.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t they all,” he muttered, and slipped past me inside.</p>
<p>I followed him in, pulling the door quietly closed. The expectedness.
He did not question my presence because my presence was expected. The
kitchen was a cavern of shadows, lit by the dying embers in a vast
hearth. The air was thick with the smells of old grease, boiled cabbage,
and yeast. A scullery maid dozed on a stool by the sink. The boy
disappeared through another door.</p>
<p>I did not hesitate. A maid in a house had purpose, direction. I
walked through the kitchen, past the sleeping girl, and into a
stone-flagged passageway. A set of narrow, twisting stairs led upwards,
the wood worn smooth in the centers by generations of servants’ feet. I
took them, my soft shoes making no sound. The building had a different
breath at night, a hollow, creaking stillness. From behind a door on the
second floor, I heard the scratch of a pen and the soft sigh of a man. A
clerk, working late.</p>
<p>The third-floor landing was darker, carpeted in a worn runner that
swallowed my steps. The light seeped from under a single door, a bar of
yellow against the gloom. I pressed my ear to the wood. Silence. Then,
the crisp, definitive sound of a ledger being closed. A chair
scraped.</p>
<p>I retreated to a shallow alcove where a broom and dustpan were kept.
I took the broom, leaning it against the wall as if I’d just been
interrupted. The performance was everything. The door opened.</p>
<p>Hendrik Visser filled the doorway, not with bulk, but with presence.
He was a tall man, lean as a whip, his hair steel-grey and swept back
from a high forehead. He wore a dark blue house coat over his shirt and
trousers. In one hand he held a ledger, in the other, a glass of what
looked like port. His face was all angles and calculation, the eyes pale
and distant, as if permanently fixed on a horizon line of profit and
loss. He did not see me, tucked in my alcove. He looked down the hall
towards the stairs, his mind clearly on other things.</p>
<p>He turned back into his office, leaving the door ajar. I heard the
clink of decanter on glass, the rustle of papers.</p>
<p>This was the moment. The knife in my apron pocket was a cold comfort.
This was not a task for a blade. It was a task for a ghost, for the
unremarked gender that cleaned up after the decisions of men. I left the
broom. I stepped to the door and pushed it open just enough to slide
through.</p>
<p>The office was a testament to controlled power. It was not large, but
every object in it was of the finest quality and utterly functional. A
vast oak desk, clear but for a brass lamp, an inkstand, and the ledger.
Shelves of identical ledgers lined one wall. A large window, now black
with night, would by day command a view of the Visser docks. A fire
guttered low in the grate. He stood with his back to me, staring into
the embers, the glass of port held loosely in his fingers.</p>
<p>He spoke without turning. “I said the figures could wait until
morning, Pieter.”</p>
<p>His voice was dry, precise. It was the voice of a man accustomed to
being obeyed, to the world arranging itself according to his
ledgers.</p>
<p>I did not answer. I let the silence stretch, a different quality of
silence than the obedient silence of a clerk.</p>
<p>He turned. His eyes found me, and for a fraction of a second, there
was no recognition, only a flicker of irritation at the interruption.
Then the irritation cooled into something harder, more analytical. He
looked at the grey dress, the apron, the downcast eyes I no longer
bothered to fully maintain.</p>
<p>“You are not from this house,” he stated. It was not a question.</p>
<p>“No, meneer.”</p>
<p>“How did you get in?”</p>
<p>“The kitchen door was open, meneer.”</p>
<p>He took a slow sip of his port, his gaze never leaving me. He was
assessing me as he would a piece of dubious cargo. “You are the one they
are sieving for. The woman from the river.”</p>
<p>I said nothing. The admission was in my presence, in the quiet
defiance of my posture.</p>
<p>A faint, cold smile touched his lips. “And you come to me. In a
maid’s dress. That is either remarkably stupid or remarkably bold. Which
is it?”</p>
<p>“I came to ask a question, meneer.”</p>
<p>He raised an eyebrow, amused. “A question. You disrupt my night,
invade my premises, and you wish to conduct an interview? You have the
advantage of me. You know my name. I do not know yours.”</p>
<p>“Els.”</p>
<p>“Els.” He rolled the name on his tongue, finding no flavor there.
“And your question, Els?”</p>
<p>I met his pale eyes fully then, dropping the pretense of the maid.
“The <em>Zuiderkroon</em> sails on the morning tide. Its manifest is
sealed by your office. What is in hold seven?”</p>
<p>All amusement vanished from his face. It became a mask of polished
stone. He set his glass down on the desk with a soft, definitive click.
“You are not a customs inspector. You are not a rival merchant. You are
a barmaid with a talent for trouble. Why would you care about a ship’s
hold?”</p>
<p>“Because people who ask about it end up in the river.”</p>
<p>“An occupational hazard of curiosity in this city.” He walked around
his desk, not approaching me, but moving to stand behind it, placing its
solid bulk between us. A tactical repositioning. “Hold seven contains
machine parts. Lathes. For the Swedish ironworks. The paperwork is in
order.”</p>
<p>“Machine parts do not require a man like Maarten to guard them. Or a
man like De Wilde to kill for them.”</p>
<p>The name De Wilde did what I hoped it would. A tiny fissure appeared
in the stone. A minute tightening around his eyes. He knew the name. He
knew the kind of work it implied.</p>
<p>“You are speaking of things beyond your understanding,” he said, his
voice lower. “You have stumbled into a game where the pieces are not
yours to move.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. de Wit gave me the piece,” I said.</p>
<p>Now the stone cracked. His hand, resting on the ledger, went very
still. The name of his former master’s widow, spoken in this context,
was a key turning in a lock he thought sealed. He looked at me anew, not
as a nuisance, but as a genuine anomaly. A variable his ledger had not
accounted for.</p>
<p>“Agatha,” he breathed, the word a mix of disbelief and dawning fury.
“She sent you here. In this… costume.”</p>
<p>“She told me to make it sing.”</p>
<p>He was silent for a long moment, his gaze turning inward, computing.
I could see the connections being made behind his eyes: the sieving, the
missing woman, the valise from his old master’s house, the question
about the hold. He arrived at the conclusion with the speed of a master
accountant.</p>
<p>“You have the case,” he said.</p>
<p>“I had it.”</p>
<p>“And you think coming here, asking me this, will achieve what? My
confession? A change of heart?” A bitter laugh escaped him. “You are a
message from a ghost, nothing more. Agatha seeks to haunt me from her
attic. It is a pathetic gesture.”</p>
<p>“What is in the hold, Visser?”</p>
<p>He leaned forward, his palms flat on the desk. “Power, you foolish
woman. Pure, condensed power. Not guilders, not influence. The kind of
power that rewrites maps and topples councils. The kind of power your
mind cannot even encompass. It is a transaction. A delivery. The
culmination of twenty years of patience and planning. And it is none of
your concern.”</p>
<p>“It became my concern when your men tried to put me in the
water.”</p>
<p>“A regrettable overzealousness. You were seen with the wrong person.
You became a loose thread. Loose threads are clipped.” He straightened.
“But you are not a thread. You are a splinter. And you have walked into
the heart of the wood. Pieter!”</p>
<p>His call was sharp, clear. From down the hall, I heard the clerk’s
door open, footsteps.</p>
<p>The performance was over. The shield of the dress was paper against
the direct gaze of its master. I did not run for the door. He would
expect that. I moved towards the window.</p>
<p>“There is no exit there,” Visser said, a note of contempt returning.
“It is three floors to the cobbles.”</p>
<p>The footsteps were in the hallway now. Not just Pieter’s. Heavier,
quicker. More than one.</p>
<p>I reached the window, fumbling with the latch. It was stiff, painted
shut. I yanked at it, the cheap fabric of the dress straining at my
shoulders.</p>
<p>The office door opened. Pieter, a thin man with ink-stained fingers,
stood there, blinking. Behind him were two others—not clerks. They had
the broad shoulders and empty eyes of warehouse enforcers, men who
handled crates and problems with equal brute force.</p>
<p>“Take her,” Visser said, his voice returning to its dry, managerial
calm. “Quietly. The same as the others.”</p>
<p>The two men stepped forward. I stopped fighting the latch. My hand
dipped into my apron pocket and closed around the bone handle of the
paring knife. I did not draw it. I turned to face Visser, my back to the
dark window.</p>
<p>“Machine parts,” I said, my voice flat. “For the Swedish
ironworks.”</p>
<p>He nodded, a dismissive gesture. “Precisely.”</p>
<p>The enforcers were three paces away. Pieter hovered in the doorway, a
spectator.</p>
<p>“Then you won’t mind,” I said, “if I check the paperwork.”</p>
<p>With my free hand, I swept the brass desk lamp off the desk. It was
heavy, full of oil. It struck the floor with a crash of glass and metal,
and the oil, fed by the wick, erupted in a <em>whoosh</em> of hungry
flame across the dry wood and the scattered papers.</p>
<p>Visser’s composure shattered. “You mad bitch!”</p>
<p>The enforcers halted, startled by the sudden wall of heat and light
that bloomed between us. The fire, fed by ledger pages, leaped towards
the shelves. Pieter cried out.</p>
<p>In the chaos, I turned back to the window. This time, I did not
fumble. I drove the heel of the paring knife’s handle against the latch,
once, twice. The old paint cracked. I wrenched it open.</p>
<p>Cold, wet night air rushed in, battling the heat of the fire. Below
was a sheer drop to a brick-paved courtyard.</p>
<p>“Stop her!” Visser roared, beating at the flames on his desk with his
house coat.</p>
<p>One of the enforcers lunged through the growing fire, his hand
grabbing for my arm. I twisted, and the coarse sleeve of the maid’s
dress tore in his grip. I brought the paring knife up, not to stab, but
to slash—a sharp, shallow cut across the back of his grasping hand. He
snarled, recoiling more in surprise than pain.</p>
<p>It was enough. I put a foot on the windowsill, the city’s breath cold
on my face. I did not look down. I looked at Hendrik Visser, his face a
mask of fury illuminated by his own burning ledgers.</p>
<p>“I’ll be checking the manifest,” I said.</p>
<p>Then I pushed myself out, not down, but across the narrow gap to the
roof of the adjacent sugar refinery. It was a leap of faith and
desperation, a span of five feet of black, rainy air. The apron
billowed, the grey dress flapped. My feet hit the sloped, lead-clad
roof, skidded on the wet metal, and I fell forward, my hands scrabbling
for purchase. I slid, a cascade of noise, until my toes jammed against a
runoff gutter.</p>
<p>I lay there, gasping, the smell of burning ledger and my own fear
sharp in my nose. Shouts echoed from Visser’s window. They would not
follow this way. They would take the stairs, flood into the lane. I had
minutes.</p>
<p>I pushed myself up. The refinery roof was a complex terrain of vents
and chimneys. I moved across it, away from the light and the noise, my
body aching, the maid’s dress torn and smudged with soot. The shield was
gone, burned away in that office. They knew my face now. They knew I had
the knowledge, and the will to act on it.</p>
<p>But I knew something, too. His reaction was the confirmation. Hold
seven of the <em>Zuiderkroon</em> did not contain lathes. It contained
the reason for everything. The source of the power he coveted. And he
was terrified I would reach it.</p>
<p>I dropped from the refinery roof into a different alley, my body a
symphony of new pains. The curfew bell began to toll, a deep, sonorous
knell that rolled over the city. The sieving would intensify. They would
be looking for a maid, now. A specific maid, with a torn dress and a
knife.</p>
<p>I had no weapon but the truth. No shield but the audacity he thought
my gender incapable of. The board was on fire. And I was not a piece. I
was the hand that held the match.</p>
<p>Somewhere to the west, in the vast, dark throat of the river, the
<em>Zuiderkroon</em> waited for the tide. It was no longer just a ship.
It was a vault. And I had just blown the lock off its secret.</p>
<p>I melted into the maze of the old city, a grey ghost against the
older stones, the taste of smoke and port on the air behind me. The hunt
was no longer me fleeing them. It was me hunting the truth, and they
knew it. The game had changed again. And for the first time, I saw a
flicker of fear in the eyes of the man who kept the ledgers.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-20-1"><strong>Chapter 20</strong></h2>
<p>The rain had gentled to a persistent, probing mist that seeped
through stone and spirit alike. It beaded on the wool of my stolen
jacket—a man’s work coat, rough and smelling of fish-oil and sweat,
taken from a line in a cramped courtyard. The grey dress was a sodden
bundle weighted with a brick and dropped into a canal. I was a
dockworker now, cap pulled low, shoulders hunched in a way that felt
less like disguise and more like the natural curl of a creature
expecting a blow.</p>
<p>The knowledge was a cold, hard stone in my gut. Hold seven. The
source. It was no longer an abstract suspicion in a ledger; it was a
physical place, a thing I could touch, if I could only reach it. De
Vries’s fear had been a hotter, brighter thing than any anger. It had
been the pure, incandescent terror of a man who sees the linchpin of his
world wobble. That terror was my compass now.</p>
<p>But the city had tightened like a fist around a suspected infection.
Patrols moved in pairs, their boots a synchronized threat on the wet
cobbles. The usual nocturnal murmur of the docks—the furtive deals, the
loading of contraband by lantern-light—was absent, smothered under the
weight of official attention. The <em>Zuiderkroon</em> was a silhouette
against the lesser dark of the river, a black cut-out studded with a few
guarded pinpricks of light. A vault, indeed. And every eye on the
waterfront was a lock.</p>
<p>I needed a key. Not a physical one. A distraction. A shift in the
board that would pull their gaze away from the ship and the river.</p>
<p>Jan’s face surfaced in my mind, the way he’d pushed the
<em>jenever</em> across the zinc. Payment expected later. Usually coin.
But he dealt in other currencies: information, silence, the careful
direction of a certain kind of clientele. He was a pivot. Men like De
Vries saw the <em>De Visser</em> as a useful gutter, a place where the
dregs of their schemes could be quietly disposed of. They never
considered that the gutter had ears, and a memory, and its own slow,
patient currents.</p>
<p>The tavern was quieter than I’d ever seen it. The usual crowd of
off-shift refinery men and canal-boat pilots was thin, made up of the
most desperate or the most connected. A tense silence hung in the air,
thicker than the smoke. Conversations were whispers. The clink of a
glass was a minor explosion.</p>
<p>Jan was polishing the same spot on the counter with a grim,
methodical energy. He didn’t look up as I approached, my work-boots
making soft, wet sounds on the floorboards. I didn’t take a stool. I
stood at the end of the bar, where the light was poorest.</p>
<p>“They’re pulling men from the east-end refineries,” I said, my voice
low, stripped of anything that could be called feminine. It was just a
rasp of fatigue. “Double watches on the company warehouses. Not for
theft. For containment.”</p>
<p>His polishing didn’t falter. “Bad weather makes for poor
security.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the weather. It’s a leak. A specific one. They think it’s
headed for the river.”</p>
<p>Now he looked up. His eyes, small and dark in the forest of his
beard, held no surprise. Only a weary calculation. He saw the man’s
coat, the cap, the posture. But he looked past it, to the set of my jaw,
the unblinking directness of my gaze. He saw <em>me</em>. “The river is
a big place. Easy to drown in.”</p>
<p>“Not if every skiff and lighter is being stopped and searched. Not if
the Port Master’s men have orders to detain anything female and alone.”
I let a hint of the old voice through, a sliver of steel. “They’ve
painted a target. And they’re holding the brush.”</p>
<p>He sighed, a sound like gravel shifting. He poured two fingers of
<em>jenever</em> into a tumbler and slid it toward me. “And you’re here
to… what? Wait for the tide?”</p>
<p>“I’m here to change it.” I left the glass untouched. “The
<em>Zuiderkroon</em> sails with the morning tide. Before then, they’ll
move the cargo from hold seven. It’s too hot to stay. They’ll try to
land it somewhere quiet, upriver or along the coast. They need a
distraction. A bigger fire to fight.”</p>
<p>A flicker in his eyes. Not interest. Caution. “Starting fires is a
young man’s game. It leaves ashes. And bodies.”</p>
<p>“This city runs on a slow fire, Jan. It’s just contained in furnaces
and ledgers and the bellies of ships. All I’m suggesting is… redirecting
the fuel. For an hour. Maybe two.” I leaned forward, my palms flat on
the sticky wood. “The east-end refinery men. They’re restless. Pulled
from their shifts, told it’s for security, but they see the company
guards getting bonus pay. They smell the inequality. It’s a
tinderbox.”</p>
<p>He laughed, a short, humorless bark. “And you want me to strike the
match? I run a tavern, not a revolution.”</p>
<p>“You run a clearing house. For grievances, and for solutions. You
know the foreman, Pieter. The one with the debt to the company store.
The one whose brother vanished after asking about pension funds.” I’d
heard the stories here, in this room, over months. The low, resentful
murmurs I’d filed away as background noise. Now they were a ledger of a
different kind. “He’s proud. And angry. If he thought the company was
using him and his men as pawns, to cover something that would make the
directors richer while his family starves… his pride wouldn’t let him
stand for it.”</p>
<p>Jan studied me for a long moment. The guttural murmur of the tavern
seemed to recede. Here was the calculation: my value against my danger.
I was danger incarnate now. But I was also a vector. A way to direct the
coming explosion away from his walls, and toward the interests of the
men who looked down on this place and everyone in it.</p>
<p>“What do you offer?” he asked finally. Not in coin.</p>
<p>“The truth. The reason for the panic. Not rumors. Not ‘company
business.’ The fact that De Vries is terrified of what’s in that hold.
That he’d beggar every man in this room to protect it. Give Pieter that.
Not as a plea. As a weapon. Let him decide what to do with it.”</p>
<p>He nodded, slowly. A decision made. “The <em>jenever</em> is on the
house tonight. For certain customers. The talk will be… pointed.” He met
my eyes. “But you won’t be here to see it. And if you are caught, you
fell from a roof. You stole that coat. You have never spoken to me.”</p>
<p>“Understood.” I finally took the glass, tossed the liquor back. It
was fire and caraway and the taste of a bargain with the devil you know.
“One more thing. I need to get to the <em>Zuiderkroon</em>. Not at the
docks. Out in the stream. After the distraction starts, but before they
can move the cargo.”</p>
<p>He stared at me as if I’d asked him to fetch the moon. Then a slow,
grudging respect dawned in his face. “Madness.”</p>
<p>“The only currency they don’t account for.”</p>
<p>He jerked his head toward the back. “There’s a boy. Klaas. He’s
simple. He loves the river. He knows every current, every eddy, like a
lover’s skin. He takes a skiff out at night sometimes, to be away from
the noise. He moors it at the old, broken pier behind the tannery. No
one bothers him.” Jan’s gaze was flint. “If you bother him, if you bring
trouble to his boat, I will find you. And what I will do will make De
Vries look like a gentleman.”</p>
<p>“Where will he be?”</p>
<p>“Where he always is. Looking at the water.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The broken pier was a skeleton of blackened wood reaching a few
futile feet into the dark water. The tannery stench was a physical wall,
a reek of chemicals and decay that made the eyes water. And there,
sitting on the very end with his legs dangling over, was a hunched
figure.</p>
<p>Klaas was maybe sixteen, with a round, placid face and eyes that held
the river’s constant movement. He didn’t startle as I approached. He
just turned his head, his expression open as a child’s.</p>
<p>“You’re not supposed to be here,” he said, his voice soft. “It’s my
place.”</p>
<p>“Jan sent me.”</p>
<p>At Jan’s name, his suspicion eased. “Oh. Do you like the water?”</p>
<p>“I need to use it. I need to get to a ship out in the stream. The big
one, with the three masts.”</p>
<p>“The <em>Kroon</em>,” he said, nodding. “She’s heavy in the water.
Sitting low. They’ve been loading her all week. At night.” He said it as
simple fact, with no implied secrecy.</p>
<p>“Can you take me? In your skiff? When… when there’s a lot of noise
and light from the refineries?”</p>
<p>He considered this, looking back at the river. “The current is tricky
there. It pulls toward the dredging channel. You have to know how to use
the eddy behind the chain-boat. Otherwise you’ll be swept past.” He
stood up, brushing off his trousers. “I can show you the eddy.”</p>
<p>He led me to a tiny, tar-painted skiff tied to a rusted ring. It was
beautifully kept, the oarlocks greased, the single pair of oars worn
smooth by his hands. He didn’t ask why. He didn’t ask about the man’s
coat, the tension in my shoulders. The river was his language, and my
request was a phrase he understood.</p>
<p>We waited. The mist turned to a light, cold rain. The city sounds
were muffled, distant. Then, a change. Not a sound at first, but a
vibration in the air, a shift in the quality of the darkness to the
east. A faint, orange glow bloomed above the rooftops, not the steady
light of refinery furnaces, but a leaping, hungry illumination.</p>
<p>Shouts followed, distorted by distance into a single roar of anger. A
bell began to clang, not the slow curfew bell, but the rapid, frantic
alarm of the fire watch. The distraction was not a small fire. It was a
riot.</p>
<p>Klaas looked toward the glow, his face calm. “That’s the noise,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He untied the skiff, held it steady as I climbed in, my movements
clumsy with a tension he did not share. He pushed us off with a single,
expert shove against the pilings and slid the oars into the water. We
moved into the blackness of the river, the sounds of the city fracturing
into distinct waves of noise: the alarm bells, a deeper, booming crash
that might have been a door being forced, the rising, unified chant of
men’s voices.</p>
<p>Klaas rowed with an effortless, rhythmic grace, his eyes on the
water, reading its surface like a page. He angled us not directly toward
the <em>Zuiderkroon</em>, but upstream, letting the current catch us.
The ship grew from a silhouette to a vast, wall-sided mass. Lanterns
swung on its deck, revealing clusters of men at the rails, looking
toward the commotion on shore. The distraction was holding.</p>
<p>“The eddy,” Klaas whispered, and with a few strong, silent pulls, he
swung the skiff into a patch of strangely still water behind a moored
dredge barge. The current wanted to pull us past the ship’s stern, but
here, we hung, bobbing gently, hidden in the deeper shadow of the barge.
We were amidships, just aft of the great, dark bulge of the hull that
was hold seven.</p>
<p>A loading door was set into the ship’s side, about ten feet above the
waterline. It was closed. A Jacob’s ladder, used for pilots, was rolled
and secured beside it. My way in.</p>
<p>“I can’t hold here long,” Klaas murmured. “The eddy spits you
out.”</p>
<p>I looked at the slick, black hull, at the small, distant rectangle of
the door. It was impossible. A leap from a moving skiff, a climb with no
proper handholds. The audacity he thought my gender incapable of. It was
all I had.</p>
<p>I stripped off the heavy work coat, let it fall into the bilge.
Underneath, I wore dark, close-fitting clothes I’d taken from the same
line—a man’s shirt and trousers, rolled at the cuff. I tied the cap
tighter on my head.</p>
<p>“When I jump, you go,” I said. “Don’t look back. Don’t wait.”</p>
<p>Klaas nodded. “The river will take you, if you fall.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>I waited for the skiff to rise on a small swell. As it neared the
apex, I stood, my balance precarious. I focused on a rusted bolt-head
just below the loading door. A tiny, imperfect handhold. I coiled my
legs and pushed off.</p>
<p>The world became a violent lurch of motion. My fingers scraped across
cold, wet iron, caught the bolt. My body slammed against the hull, the
impact driving the air from my lungs in a silent gasp. I hung there, my
feet scrambling against the slime-covered plates. I heard the soft,
quick dip of Klaas’s oars as he pulled away, swallowed by the dark.</p>
<p>Above, the sounds of the ship were clearer: shouts of confusion,
orders bellowed to keep men at their stations, to ignore the shore. They
were looking landward. Not down.</p>
<p>I began to climb. It was a spider’s progress, finding cracks between
plates, the heads of rivets, the lip of a scupper. Each grip was a
gamble, each upward shift of weight a potential plunge into the waiting
river. My muscles screamed, burned from the roof-fall, the running, the
cold. The loading door was a mere arm’s length away. I stretched, my
fingers finding the cold iron handle. It was dogged shut from the
inside.</p>
<p>I hung there, pressed against the ship, the reality of my position
crashing down. I was a barnacle on a leviathan. I had no tools, no plan
beyond this point. The truth was inside, but I was stuck to the outside
of its vault.</p>
<p>Then, a vibration through the iron. A deep, metallic <em>clunk</em>
from within the hull, right behind the door. Machinery engaging. A
winch. They were moving something. Preparing.</p>
<p>The handle above my head began to turn.</p>
<p>I froze, my blood turning to ice in my veins. The door was opening
outward. It would swing out and knock me into the water. I had
seconds.</p>
<p>I pushed sideways along the hull, fingers clawing for any purchase. I
found the edge of the rolled Jacob’s ladder, the rough hemp of its
ropes. As the loading door creaked open, a wedge of yellow lantern-light
slicing the darkness, I hooked my arm through the ladder’s rungs and
pulled my body tight against its roll, making myself part of the ship’s
furniture.</p>
<p>The door swung open fully. A man stood silhouetted in the light, his
face in shadow. He leaned out, looking toward the shore, the reflected
glow of the distant riot dancing on his features. It was one of De
Vries’s clerks, the nervous one from the office.</p>
<p>“Madness,” he muttered to someone inside. “The whole east end is
alight. He says it changes nothing. We proceed.”</p>
<p>“The lighter is ready?” another voice asked from within.</p>
<p>“Almost. The crane is secured to the load. We just need the all-clear
from the bridge. It’s chaos up there. Half the crew are gawping at the
flames.”</p>
<p>He stayed there, leaning on the door frame, a sentry bored with his
post. I hung beside him, close enough to see the stubble on his jaw, to
smell the tobacco on his breath. My arm ached with the strain of holding
still. A drop of water from my hair fell, landing on his hand resting on
the door.</p>
<p>He looked at his hand, then up, directly at the rolled ladder.</p>
<p>His eyes met mine.</p>
<p>For a heartbeat that spanned an eternity, we stared at each other.
His were wide with the slow-dawning horror of the impossible. A face
from a burning office, now clinging to the side of his ship. A ghost
made flesh, and dripping wet.</p>
<p>His mouth opened to cry out.</p>
<p>I moved. My free hand shot out, not for the door, but for the lantern
he’d set on the deck just inside. I snatched it by its wire handle and
swung it in a short, brutal arc. The glass shattered against the side of
his head. The flame guttered and died on the wet iron. He crumpled
without a sound, slumping over the door sill.</p>
<p>I hauled myself over him, into the hold.</p>
<p>The smell hit me first. It was not the smell of a ship’s hold—not of
damp timber, or burlap, or spices. It was dry, and cold, and carried a
faint, acrid tang of ozone and something else, something profoundly
mineral, like the air deep inside a cave. The space was vast, lit by a
few suspended lanterns. And it was not filled with crates or
machinery.</p>
<p>It was a laboratory.</p>
<p>Long wooden tables ran the length of the hold, bolted to the deck.
They were laden not with cargo, but with glassware: beakers, retorts,
distillation coils of a complexity I’d only seen in engravings of
alchemists’ dens. There were scales with weights of polished brass,
notebooks stacked in precise piles, and jars containing powders and
liquids of unnatural colors—a vivid, sickly green, a purple so deep it
was almost black.</p>
<p>In the center of the space, secured to the deck by heavy iron
brackets, was the source of the power he coveted.</p>
<p>It was a machine, but unlike any I had ever seen. It stood about
eight feet tall, a construct of polished copper, glass cylinders, and
thick, insulated cables that snaked away to a bank of monstrous chemical
batteries. At its heart, contained within a glass sphere held in a
cradle of copper claws, was a rock.</p>
<p>It was not a gem. It was rough, about the size of a man’s fist, and
it glowed. Not with heat or reflected light, but with its own internal,
pulsating radiance. A cold, blue-white light that throbbed like a slow,
steady heartbeat. It cast sharp, dancing shadows through the hold. With
each pulse, a faint, hair-raising crackle whispered from the machine,
and the air tasted sharper, more metallic.</p>
<p>This was it. Not gold, not spices. Not a weapon, in the conventional
sense. It was a source. A battery of unimaginable potency. De Vries
wasn’t just cornering a market; he was trying to corner the future
itself. The refineries, the shipping lanes, the political favors—they
were all just the scaffolding to protect and exploit <em>this</em>. A
piece of a star, fallen to earth and caged in glass.</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>The voice came from the far end of the hold, near a secondary hatch.
A man stepped from behind a bank of instrumentation. He was tall, gaunt,
dressed not in sailor’s gear but in a stained leather apron over a fine
shirt. His hands were long-fingered, delicate, stained with chemical
burns. His eyes, magnified by thick spectacles, were fixed on me with a
fanatic’s intensity. This was the mind, the alchemist. The keeper of the
stone.</p>
<p>He held a heavy glass stirring rod like a club. “You are the
disruption. The variable in the equation.”</p>
<p>I stood, the broken lantern handle still in my hand, water pooling at
my feet. I was inside the vault. The truth was before me, humming with
alien energy. But I was not alone with it.</p>
<p>“He’s terrified of anyone seeing this,” I said, my voice echoing
strangely in the cavernous, charged space. “Why? What does it
<em>do</em>?”</p>
<p>The alchemist’s lips stretched into a thin, proud smile. “It
redefines <em>possible</em>. It is not a thing that <em>does</em>. It is
a thing that <em>allows</em>. Light without flame. Motion without steam.
A silent, clean, endless pulse of power.” His gaze was rapt upon the
glowing stone. “He is terrified because he is a merchant. He understands
control of a commodity. He does not understand a paradigm. And paradigms
are harder to kill than people.”</p>
<p>Footsteps pounded on the deck above, urgent. Shouts filtered down.
They had found the clerk at the door.</p>
<p>The alchemist’s smile vanished. He looked from the stone to me, and
his fanaticism curdled into a cold, pragmatic fear. “You have seen it.
That is enough. You must not leave. The equation must be balanced.”</p>
<p>He raised the glass rod and started toward me, not with a fighter’s
grace, but with the grim determination of a man protecting his life’s
work.</p>
<p>I backed away, my eyes scanning the tables. The truth was here,
dazzling and terrible. But the vault had become a cage. And the keeper
of the truth was coming to silence the witness, his spectacles gleaming
in the cold, pulsating light of the stone that promised a new world, and
had made this one a hunting ground.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-21-1"><strong>Chapter 21</strong></h2>
<p>The glass rod came down not with a fighter’s swing, but with the
terrible, efficient arc of a butcher’s cleaver. It was meant to split my
skull, to end the equation. I threw myself sideways, the movement a wet,
graceless stumble. The rod whistled past my ear and struck the edge of
the iron table with a crystalline <em>pang</em> that shivered up into my
teeth. A long, wicked shard spun away into the shadows.</p>
<p>The alchemist—no, the <em>technician</em>, the
<em>keeper</em>—blinked behind his spectacles, surprised by the
resistance of matter. His world was one of theory and luminous
potential. Mine was one of grease-slick floors and the immediate,
pressing need to not have my brains spilled.</p>
<p>I came up with the broken lantern handle reversed in my grip, the
splintered end a crude spike. The water from my clothes had spread
around me, a dark halo on the stone. He adjusted his grip on the rod,
the remaining length a jagged club. His eyes flickered past me, to the
stone. Its light pulsed, a slow, patient heartbeat that painted the
cavern in waves of cold blue and deep, velvety shadow. It was watching.
Or it felt like it was watching.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do his killing,” I said, my voice low, measured
against the hum. “A man like Visser understands a knife, a debt, a
threat. This?” I jerked my chin toward the stone. “This is a god. You
don’t serve it by being his street-corner thug.”</p>
<p>His lips, thin and bloodless, tightened. “You reduce it to metaphor.
It is not a god. It is a key. And he holds the door.” He took a step,
his leather apron creaking. “You are a loose thread. You unravel
things.”</p>
<p>Above us, the pounding became a thunder. A heavy object slammed
against the vault door—a ram, maybe, or a shoulder fueled by panic. The
clerk’s body wouldn’t hold them long. The keeper heard it too. A tic
jumped beneath his eye. His sanctuary was breached. The pure math of his
work was now corrupted by the messy variables of men with clubs and
questions.</p>
<p>He lunged again. This time the rod came in a sideways sweep, aiming
for my ribs. I didn’t try to block it; glass against iron-shod wood was
a losing proposition. I stepped inside the swing, into the space his
fanaticism had left empty. The world narrowed to the smell of his
chemicals—sour ammonia, sharp ozone—and the magnified, frantic blue of
his eyes behind their lenses.</p>
<p>I drove the splintered end of the lantern handle into the meat of his
thigh.</p>
<p>It was not a deep wound. The wood was rough, not sharp. But it was a
shock. A violation of his clinical space. He gasped, a sound of profound
indignation, and stumbled back, his free hand going to the puncture in
his leather apron. A dark bloom spread, not from the shallow stab, but
from the broken glass still embedded in the rod’s end, which had raked
his own palm. He stared at the blood, his own, with a kind of detached
curiosity.</p>
<p>The door above groaned. A sharp, metallic <em>crack</em> echoed down
the shaft. They were through the lock.</p>
<p>The keeper’s gaze snapped from his hand to me, to the stone, then to
the spiral stairs. The calculus in his head was visible: the specimen,
the witness, the invaders. The specimen was paramount. The witness was a
contaminant. The invaders were a tide.</p>
<p>He made his choice. With a snarl that held more anguish than anger,
he hurled the glass rod at my head. I ducked, and it shattered against a
bank of copper coils with a sound like falling chimes. Then he turned
and ran, not for the stairs, but deeper into the vault, toward a
smaller, iron-banded door I hadn’t seen, half-hidden behind a rack of
ceramic batteries humming with captured light.</p>
<p>He was abandoning his creation. Or he was trusting it to be a harder
secret to steal than a man.</p>
<p>I didn’t chase him. The truth wasn’t in the man. It was here,
thrumming in the air, making the fillings in my teeth ache. The door at
the top of the stairs burst open. Boots on metal, shouting. Visser’s
voice, raw with a fury that was mostly fear, cut through the din. “Find
her! Kill her! Nothing else matters!”</p>
<p>They thought the stone was just a jewel, a prize. They didn’t feel
its pulse in their marrow.</p>
<p>I looked at the stone on its pedestal. The alchemist’s words echoed.
<em>A thing that allows.</em> It was a heart. A silent, beating heart
for a machine not yet built. To take it would be to claim a kingdom. To
leave it was to leave a weapon in the hands of a frightened, greedy
man.</p>
<p>But I was not a thief of kingdoms. I was a finder of secrets. And a
secret seen is a secret halved.</p>
<p>I moved. Not toward the stone, but toward the nearest worktable. My
hands, slick with canal water and now a smear of the keeper’s blood,
swept across its surface. I wasn’t looking for tools. I was looking for
notes. The scrawl of genius. I snatched up a leather-bound journal, its
pages thick with diagrams and cramped, frantic script. I shoved it
inside my coat, against my ribs. It was a cold, hard rectangle of
truth.</p>
<p>A heavy glass beaker stood next to a rack of vials. I grabbed it,
hefted its weight. Then I turned and threw it, not at the men now
clattering down the stairs, but at the stone’s pedestal.</p>
<p>It was a terrible shot. I wasn’t aiming to hit the stone itself—the
thought of what that impact might do curdled my blood—but at the base.
The beaker struck the iron support with a crash. Glass and a clear,
viscous fluid exploded. The fluid hit the cables snaking from the
stone’s base. For a heartbeat, nothing.</p>
<p>Then the stone flared.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a pulse. It was a silent, blinding detonation of blue-white
light. It etched the bones of my hands against my eyelids. It bleached
the color from the world, turning everything to stark negative: black
shadows, white edges. A wave of force, not heat but a profound, shoving
pressure, slammed into my chest. It lifted me off my feet and threw me
back against the iron table. My breath left me in a grunt of pure
shock.</p>
<p>The men on the stairs cried out—not in pain, but in primal terror.
The light was wrong. It was a color that had no business in the belly of
a barge. It was the light of a cold, new sun.</p>
<p>The glare died as suddenly as it had bloomed, collapsing back into
the stone’s core, but its afterimage danced in my vision like a ghost.
The hum had changed. It was higher now, strained, a wire vibrating near
its breaking point. Thin tendrils of smoke rose from the scorched cables
at the pedestal’s base.</p>
<p>I pushed myself up, my ears ringing in the new silence. The keeper’s
door hung open, a black rectangle. He was gone. On the stairs, three of
Visser’s men were frozen, clutching the railing, their faces masks of
superstitious dread. They had come down for a woman, a fight in the
dark. They had found a silent, screaming star.</p>
<p>Visser stood behind them, at the top of the stairs. The unnatural
light had hollowed his face, made his eyes into dark pits. He wasn’t
looking at me. He was staring at the stone, now flickering erratically,
like a heart in arrhythmia. His treasure was broken. Or waking up. He
couldn’t tell which, and the not-knowing was a torture worse than any
threat I could pose.</p>
<p>“Get it,” he whispered, the command carrying in the dead air. “Get it
under cover. Now.”</p>
<p>His men didn’t move. They were sailors, used to wind and wave and the
tangible violence of knives. This was a witchcraft that stripped them of
their courage.</p>
<p>I used their paralysis. While they stared at the dying light, I moved
toward the only other exit: the keeper’s door. I kept low, behind the
tables, my wet clothes making no sound on the stone. The journal pressed
against my side, a stolen bible of this new, terrible faith.</p>
<p>One of the men, younger, with a weal of a fresh burn across his
cheek, finally shook himself. He saw my movement. “Boss,” he hissed.</p>
<p>Visser’s gaze snapped to me. The fear in his eyes crystallized into a
hatred so pure it was almost clean. I had seen. I had broken. I had to
be erased, not just killed, but unmade from the history of this moment.
“Her,” he said, the word flat and final. “Just her.”</p>
<p>The younger man came down the last of the stairs, drawing a long,
tar-stained knife from his belt. The other two, galvanized by a command
they understood, followed. The stone was forgotten. I was a human
problem, and they had human solutions.</p>
<p>I reached the small door and slipped through, into darkness. A narrow
corridor, hewn from the ship’s timbers, smelling of damp rot and
chemical runoff. I pulled the door shut behind me. There was no lock,
only a simple latch. It wouldn’t hold them.</p>
<p>I ran. The corridor sloped upward, following the curve of the hull.
Pipes hissed overhead. Somewhere ahead, water dripped in a steady,
maddening rhythm. My breath sawed in my throat, the earlier exhaustion
now a lead weight in my limbs. The coat was a sodden beast on my
shoulders, the journal a slab of stone.</p>
<p>The door behind me crashed open. Boots pounded in the passage. They
didn’t shout. They were hunting now, and silence was the tool.</p>
<p>The corridor ended at a T-junction. To the left, a faint, greasy
yellow glow suggested a working area, maybe the keeper’s private lab. To
the right, pitch black, and a cooler draft carrying the smell of the
canal. The way out.</p>
<p>I went right.</p>
<p>The darkness was absolute. I kept one hand on the rough, wet timber
of the wall, the other extended ahead, feeling for obstacles. The draft
grew stronger. Ahead, a faint, grey suggestion of light—a grating,
perhaps, or a hatch. Freedom, or a trap.</p>
<p>A shape loomed out of the dark to my left, a deeper blackness. I
sensed more than saw the movement, the shift of air. I dropped to a
crouch. The knife swished through the space where my neck had been,
striking the wall with a solid <em>thunk</em>. The younger man. He’d
found a parallel passage, or he knew the maze better than I did.</p>
<p>I didn’t rise. I scissored my legs out, sweeping his feet from under
him. He went down with a choked curse, the knife skittering away. I was
on him before he could draw breath, my knees pinning his shoulders, my
hands finding his face in the dark. I didn’t punch. I pressed my thumbs
hard into his eyes, not to blind, but to panic. He bucked, gagging, his
hands clawing at my wrists. I held the pressure for a count of two, then
released and rolled off, snatching for the knife. My fingers closed on
the hilt.</p>
<p>He was scrambling back, whimpering, his hands to his face. I stood,
the knife in my hand. The other two were close; I could hear their
cautious steps in the main corridor.</p>
<p>The grey light was stronger now. Ten paces ahead was a heavy iron
grate, covering a circular opening in the hull. Moonlight and the
reflected gaslights of the dock filtered through, illuminating a small,
empty space—a dry storage locker, now abandoned. The grate was held by
four large, rusted wingnuts.</p>
<p>I sheathed the knife in my belt and went to work. The first nut
turned with a shriek of metal. The second was frozen solid. I drew the
knife again, using the pommel as a hammer, beating at the stubborn wing
until it sheared off with a crack. The noise was catastrophic in the
confined space.</p>
<p>“Here!” a voice shouted from behind me. A lantern’s beam swung around
the corner, blinding me.</p>
<p>I threw my weight against the grate. With two bolts gone, it held for
a second, then buckled outward with a groan. I squeezed through the gap,
splinters tearing at my coat, and tumbled out onto a narrow, slimy ledge
just above the waterline of the barge. The canal was a black mirror
below, stinking and cold.</p>
<p>The locker was on the barge’s far side, away from the dock. Across
the water, maybe fifteen feet, was the pitted stone wall of the opposite
quay, the foundations of a warehouse. No ladder. No rope.</p>
<p>A head thrust through the grate behind me. A hand, holding a pistol,
wavered in the moonlight.</p>
<p>I didn’t think. I jumped.</p>
<p>The water was a physical agony, a shock that stopped my heart for a
beat before it began hammering against my ribs. It was not the clean,
cold shock of the sea. This was a thick, gelid stew of filth and winter.
My coat, the journal inside it, became an anchor. I fought the instinct
to thrash, to gasp. I kicked, driving downward, away from the surface
light, following the curve of the barge’s hull.</p>
<p>The pistol shot, when it came, was a muffled, watery <em>thump</em>.
The bullet tore a line of bubbles past my shoulder, spent and harmless.
I swam, my lungs burning, my hands scraping against slimy stone and
submerged timber. I counted. Ten strokes. Twenty.</p>
<p>My head broke the surface in the deep shadow between the barge and a
neighboring coal hulk. I sucked in air that tasted of tar and decay, the
sound masked by the lap of water against hulls. I treaded water,
listening.</p>
<p>Voices, angry and confused, carried from the deck of Visser’s barge.
A lantern beam swept the water where I’d jumped. It didn’t reach my
hiding place.</p>
<p>I had to move. The cold was leaching the strength from my bones,
turning my muscles to sluggish clay. I let the current, sluggish as it
was, carry me down the length of the coal hulk. At its stern, I found a
mooring chain, a thick, slimy serpent leading up to the quay. I hauled
myself out, hand over hand, the links biting into my frozen palms. Every
pull was a separate universe of effort.</p>
<p>I collapsed onto the cobbles behind a stack of empty crates, vomiting
a gout of canal water. My body shook uncontrollably, a violent,
ceaseless tremor. I was a thing of mud and ice. But the journal was
still there, a solid block of damning evidence pressed against my
shuddering heart.</p>
<p>I needed to get off the docks. Visser’s men would be fanning out,
checking every shadow. He couldn’t let me live now. I had seen the core
of his power, and I had made it sick. I had the book. I was a vector for
his ruin.</p>
<p>Pushing myself up, I staggered into the maze of alleys behind the
warehouses. I moved from pool of darkness to pool of darkness, a
creature of the in-between places. The grand houses of the Herengracht
felt a world away. Jan’s bar was a memory of warmth I might never feel
again. I had nowhere to go. The stone’s cold light was seared behind my
eyes, and the keeper’s words were a chant in my head. <em>A thing that
allows.</em></p>
<p>I understood now, in my marrow. Visser wasn’t just a thief or a
profiteer. He was a man trying to bottle lightning, to sell silence, to
own the future. And he would burn the present to the ground to keep
it.</p>
<p>A figure detached itself from a doorway ahead, blocking the narrow
passage. Tall, lean. Not one of Visser’s bruisers. The moonlight caught
the fine wool of his coat, the pale gleam of his face.</p>
<p>Rafael.</p>
<p>He didn’t speak. He simply looked at me, dripping and shaking in the
alley filth. His expression was unreadable. Not surprise. Not pity. A
kind of weary recognition, as if he’d been waiting for me to arrive at
this exact, desperate point.</p>
<p>“They’re hunting you,” he said, his voice quiet. It wasn’t a
question.</p>
<p>I nodded, my teeth chattering too hard to form words.</p>
<p>He glanced back the way I’d come, then at the sky, judging the hour.
“He’s pulled men from the watch. Paid for silence. The docks are his for
the next few hours.” He stepped closer. The scent of him—soap and clean
linen—was a brutal contrast to the reek of the canal on my skin. “You
have something he wants. More than your life.”</p>
<p>I clutched my coat tighter over the journal. “You work for him.”</p>
<p>“I work for the city,” he corrected, his tone flinty. “He is a cyst
upon it. I thought he could be lanced with careful pressure. You have
taken a sledgehammer to it.” He sighed, the sound full of a profound
fatigue. “Now it will rupture. And poison everything.”</p>
<p>He reached out a hand. Not to take the journal. To steady me. His
grip was firm, warm through my soaked sleeve. “You cannot go to ground.
He owns the ground. You cannot run. He will close the gates.”</p>
<p>“Then what?” I managed, the words slurred with cold.</p>
<p>He looked at me, and in his eyes I saw not the polished functionary,
but the man who walked the knife-edge between law and survival. “You
give him what he wants. But not on his terms. You force the rupture on
your ground. You show the cyst to the light.”</p>
<p>He was talking about a confrontation. A public one. It was
madness.</p>
<p>“He’ll kill me,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Rafael agreed, without hesitation. “He will try. But he is a
merchant. He understands an auction. A trade.” His gaze dropped to the
bulge of the journal beneath my coat. “You have the manifest. You offer
it back. In exchange for a hearing. In front of people he cannot buy, or
cannot afford to kill.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The men whose money built that stone,” he said. “The syndicate. They
are not all in his pocket. Some are… nervous. About his methods. About
the attention.” He meant the deaths. The disappearances. The clerk with
his throat cut. Me, hunted through the streets. “They meet tomorrow
night. At the <em>Koning van Denemarken</em>. A private room. He will be
there, to reassure them.”</p>
<p>The most powerful men in the city. I would be a mouse walking into a
council of cats.</p>
<p>“They’ll side with him,” I said. “Money sides with money.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” Rafael conceded. “But they are also men who hate a mess.
You are a mess. He has failed to clean you up. That makes him look weak.
And in their world, weakness is the only sin.” He released my arm. “It
is the only move you have left, Els. Stand in the light where he cannot
simply make you vanish. Make your accusation. Show your proof. And hope
the stink of his failure is stronger than the glitter of his gold.”</p>
<p>He was offering me a path, but it was a path across a tightrope, over
a pit of wolves. He was not my ally. He was a man steering a crisis
toward an outcome that might, incidentally, save his city.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked, the single word hanging in the cold air between
us.</p>
<p>For the first time, something like emotion touched his face. A faint,
grim twist of the lips. “Because I, too, have seen what that stone can
do. Not its light. What it does to the men who hold it. It makes them
see people as… variables. To be balanced out.” He met my eyes. “I find I
do not care for the equation.”</p>
<p>He turned and gestured for me to follow. “There is a place you can
dry out. A safe place. For tonight.”</p>
<p>I hesitated. This could be the trap. The neat, final solution.</p>
<p>But the cold was in my core now. The trembling was becoming a
dangerous lethargy. I had no other cards to play. I was a variable he
had not yet balanced.</p>
<p>I took a step, then another, following Rafael’s silhouette into the
deeper darkness of the alley. The journal was a lead weight. The stone’s
dying light was a ghost in my mind. And ahead, in the warm, wood-paneled
room of a gentlemen’s club, a different kind of machine awaited—one of
money, power, and polished lies. I would have to walk into its gears and
trust that my truth, ugly and dripping with canal water, was a wrench
solid enough to jam them all.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-22">Chapter 22</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-22-1"><strong>Chapter 22</strong></h2>
<p>The safe place was a room above a printer’s shop in the Jordaan. It
smelled of ink, cheap paper, and the ghost of old tobacco. Rafael left
me there with a key, a loaf of black bread, and a warning that felt like
a seal being set on a tomb.</p>
<p>“Be at <em>De Witte Olifant</em> at eight tomorrow. Ask for the
<em>Zeeuwse Kamer</em>. They will bring you up. Do not be late. Do not
be early. Wear something that does not look like you pulled it from a
bin.”</p>
<p>He did not wait for an answer. The door clicked shut, and I heard the
solid turn of a second lock in the hall. A courtesy, or a containment.
The room held a narrow bed, a washstand with a chipped pitcher, a single
chair. A window looked out onto a dark canal, the opposite house leaning
close enough to touch. It was a cell with a view.</p>
<p>I set the journal on the bed. My coat steamed in the room’s dry heat,
releasing the smell of the city’s underbelly. I peeled it off, then the
wet wool of my sweater, my fingers clumsy and numb. The cold had
migrated inward, settling in the marrow of my bones. I poured water from
the pitcher—it was clean, shockingly so—and scrubbed at my face, my
neck, the grime of the warehouse and the canal. The face in the small,
spotted mirror was a stranger’s. Pale. Eyes too dark, set in
bruise-colored sockets. A mouth that had forgotten any shape but a
line.</p>
<p>I was a mess. That was my value. My only weapon.</p>
<p>I slept then, a black and dreamless plunge, and woke to the gray,
pre-dawn light seeping between the buildings. The trembling was gone,
replaced by a hollow, resonant stillness. I felt like a shell. I ate
some of the bread. It was dense, sour. It tasted of nothing.</p>
<p>The clothes Rafael had implied I needed were folded on the chair. A
simple, dark wool dress, slightly too large, but clean. Stockings.
Sturdy, polished shoes that pinched at the heel. The uniform of a
respectable, anonymous woman. Dressing in them was an act of camouflage.
I tucked the journal into a deep pocket sewn inside the skirt, its
weight a familiar pendulum against my thigh.</p>
<p>The hours until eight were a desert. I sat by the window and watched
the canal come to life. A barge moved past, loaded with barrels. A woman
across the way shook a rug from a window. A cat picked its way along a
gutter. Ordinary life, moving with the blind, persistent rhythm of ants.
I was outside of it, a speck of grit about to be dropped into a
watchworks.</p>
<p><em>De Witte Olifant</em> was on the Herengracht, a fortress of
wealth behind a severe, classical façade. Its windows were tall, clean,
and blank. I arrived as the bells were striking eight, my borrowed shoes
silent on the swept cobbles. The door was opened by a man in a black
coat whose eyes took me in, dismissed me, and then flickered with a
faint surprise when I spoke.</p>
<p>“The <em>Zeeuwse Kamer</em>.”</p>
<p>He stepped back without a word. The interior was a hushed world of
dark wood, worn leather, and the sweet, dusty smell of old money.
Portraits of stern men in ruffs looked down from the walls. The carpet
swallowed sound. My presence here was a dissonant note, a stain on the
harmony. The man led me up a wide staircase, down a corridor lined with
closed doors, and stopped before one of polished oak. He knocked once,
opened it, and gestured me inside.</p>
<p>The room was a library. Shelves of leather-bound books rose to the
ceiling. A fire crackled in a marble hearth, and the air was thick with
the scent of cigar smoke, brandy, and beeswax. Four men were arranged in
high-backed chairs. They did not rise.</p>
<p>Visser sat nearest the fire, one leg crossed over the other, a glass
of amber liquid in his hand. He looked like he had been carved from the
same wood as the furniture, polished to a hard, impermeable sheen. His
eyes met mine, and there was nothing in them. No anger, no recognition.
I was a document to be reviewed.</p>
<p>The other three I knew by reputation, if not by sight. De Wit, the
shipping magnate, his face a roadmap of burst capillaries. Van Dijk, who
owned half the warehouses north of the IJ. And Scholten, the banker,
small and precise as a watchmaker, his fingers steepled before his
lips.</p>
<p>A fifth chair, straight-backed and unwelcoming, sat empty facing
them. My place.</p>
<p>Rafael stood by the window, his back to the room, looking out at the
canal as if the proceedings were of no interest to him. He was the
guarantor of this audience. The moderator. Or the executioner.</p>
<p>“Sit,” said De Wit, his voice a gravel rumble.</p>
<p>I sat. The chair was hard. I kept my hands in my lap, over the hidden
weight of the journal. I did not look away from them.</p>
<p>Visser took a slow sip of his drink. “Gentlemen. This is the woman I
mentioned. Els. Formerly in my employ. She has, I am given to
understand, some… grievances she wishes to air.” He said the word
<em>grievances</em> as if it were a childish thing, a tantrum.</p>
<p>“We are busy men,” Van Dijk said, his gaze cool and assessing. “This
is highly irregular.”</p>
<p>“It is,” Visser agreed. “But Rafael felt it prudent. To avoid…
further public disturbances.” He shifted his eyes to me. “Speak, then.
You have stolen from me. Conspired against me. You have made accusations
to the wrong people. Here are the right people. Say your piece.”</p>
<p>It was a masterful opening. He had framed me before I could utter a
word. A thief. A hysteric. I was not a victim bringing a charge; I was a
problem being managed.</p>
<p>The silence stretched. The fire popped. I could feel the pressure of
their collective gaze, a physical weight. They were not cats. Cats had
passion, curiosity. These men were stones. Smoothed by the flow of money
and power until all that remained was inertia and mass.</p>
<p>I did not speak to Visser. I looked at De Wit, then Van Dijk, then
Scholten.</p>
<p>“My name is Els. I was a diver for Mijnheer Visser. I retrieved
things for him from the mud. Two months ago, I retrieved a stone. A blue
stone. From the wreck of the <em>Zwarte Zee</em>.”</p>
<p>Scholten’s steepled fingers twitched. Van Dijk’s eyes narrowed a
fraction.</p>
<p>“I was instructed to bring it directly to him. I did. He took it to
his workshop. That night, a man named Pieter, his metallurgist, was
killed. His throat was cut. The official report called it a robbery.” My
voice was flat, dry. It echoed strangely in the opulent room. “I was
curious. I went back to the wreck. I found a body, wedged in the
timbers. A man, dressed in fine clothes, not sailor’s gear. He had been
dead a long time. He had a journal on him.”</p>
<p>Visser’s expression did not change. He swirled his brandy.</p>
<p>“The journal was written by a Portuguese alchemist. He was on the
<em>Zwarte Zee</em>. He called the stone the <em>Luz do Abismo</em>. The
Light of the Abyss. He wrote about what it could do. What it was for. It
wasn’t treasure. It was a key. A battery. It could store… potential.
Energy. A man’s life force. His will.” I was parroting terms I barely
understood, but the words from the journal had seared themselves into my
mind. “The alchemist was afraid. The ship’s captain, a man named
Hendriks, had taken the stone. He believed it could make him powerful.
Invincible. The last entry says the alchemist heard screaming from the
captain’s cabin. Then the ship struck the reef and went down.”</p>
<p>I pulled the journal from my pocket. The water-stained, leather-bound
book was a stark, ugly object in the refined room. I held it up. “It’s
all here.”</p>
<p>“A fascinating story,” Visser said, his tone bored. “A shipwreck
mystery. And you believe this… fairy tale… connects to me?”</p>
<p>“Pieter connected it,” I said, turning to him at last. “He was trying
to understand the stone. You were helping him. Then he was dead. And you
had the stone locked away, experimenting. You found a use for it. Not to
store a life. To drain it.”</p>
<p>Van Dijk leaned forward. “Drain it.”</p>
<p>“To power a machine,” I said. “A loom. A prototype. One that doesn’t
need a river, or steam, or a room full of women to run it. One that runs
on… this.” I tapped the journal. “On will. On focus. On the thing it
pulls out of a person when they are hooked to it. You used a girl. A
beggar girl from the docks. You used her until there was nothing left. I
found her body. In the canal behind your warehouse.”</p>
<p>For the first time, a ripple went through the room. De Wit shifted in
his chair. Scholten’s lips pursed. A dead magnate from a centuries-old
wreck was one thing. A dead beggar girl in a modern canal was another.
It was messy. It was local.</p>
<p>Visser set his glass down with a soft, definitive click. “This is
slander of the most grotesque kind. You have produced a fictional
journal and the corpse of an unfortunate urchin. You are clearly unwell.
Grief-stricken over your colleague, perhaps. Or simply ambitious. You
seek to damage me. For what? More money?”</p>
<p>He was so calm. So reasonable. He turned to the others. “Gentlemen, I
brought you here to dispel this nonsense. The stone is a curiosity. A
piezoelectric oddity I am studying for potential applications in
timekeeping. The girl’s death is a tragedy, but it has nothing to do
with me. This woman is a disgruntled former employee, collaborating with
elements in the city who wish to see my new manufactory fail.” His gaze
slid to Rafael’s back by the window. “She is a pawn. And this is a waste
of our time.”</p>
<p>The balance was tipping. I could see it in their faces. Visser’s
narrative was clean, efficient. Mine was a gothic horror story, dripping
with mud and madness. They were men of ledgers and tonnage. The
supernatural was bad business.</p>
<p>I stood up. The movement was abrupt. It broke the rhythm of the
room.</p>
<p>“It’s not a story,” I said, my voice low but sharp. “It’s a machine.
And he’s building it. Bigger. He doesn’t want to power a single loom. He
wants to power a factory. A city. And he’ll need more than beggar girls
for that. He’ll need a source. A strong source.”</p>
<p>I looked at each of them. “You think you’re safe. You think your
money, your walls, your names protect you. But you’re just a different
kind of fuel to him. You’re a variable. And when he balances his
equation, you’ll be factored in. Or out.”</p>
<p>Scholten spoke, his voice a dry rustle. “You are speaking in
hysterics, woman.”</p>
<p>“Am I?” I took a step toward Visser. He didn’t flinch. “Where is the
stone now, Mijnheer Visser? In your workshop? In your safe? Or is it
already in the new foundation, the one you’re pouring for the mill on
the Amstel? The one that will never need a coal bill? The one that will
out-produce every other concern in the city? The one that will make you
not just rich, but indispensable?”</p>
<p>That landed. I saw it hit. The mill on the Amstel was Visser’s open
secret, his next great leap. A project on a scale that required their
collective investment, their silent approval. I had aimed the wrench,
and I had struck metal.</p>
<p>Visser’s polish finally cracked. A thin, vertical line appeared
between his brows. “You have been poking around where you do not
belong.”</p>
<p>“Someone has to,” I said. “Since the police see only what you pay
them to see.”</p>
<p>Rafael turned from the window. He did not look at me. He addressed
the room. “The accusation is specific. The journal exists. The girl’s
body exists. The connection to Pieter’s death is circumstantial, but
persistent.” He paused, letting the words settle. “And there is the
matter of the stone itself. I have seen it. Its properties are…
unnatural. Mijnheer Visser’s research into its application has been
pursued with unusual secrecy. For a mere timekeeping device.”</p>
<p>He was not siding with me. He was stating facts. But in this room,
facts were weapons.</p>
<p>Visser stood. He was taller than I remembered. The firelight cast his
shadow, long and grasping, across the bookshelves. “This is absurd. You
would take the word of this… this dredged-up creature… over mine? Based
on a madman’s diary and the fantasies of a jealous rival?” His eyes
burned at Rafael.</p>
<p>“I would see the stone,” Van Dijk said quietly. “This <em>Luz</em>
thing. I would see this machine. The small one. The loom.”</p>
<p>“As would I,” said De Wit, crossing his arms over his broad
chest.</p>
<p>It was a check. Not a checkmate. They were not convinced of my truth,
but they were now uncertain of his. The stink of failure, of mess, was
in the air.</p>
<p>Visser’s jaw tightened. He smoothed his waistcoat, a quick, violent
gesture. “It is in a secure location. For study.”</p>
<p>“Then we will go to it,” Scholten said. “Now. We will all go. We will
see this wonder, or this fraud, for ourselves.”</p>
<p>Panic, cold and bright, flashed in Visser’s eyes for a single,
unguarded moment. It was the first real emotion I had seen from him. It
was more telling than any confession. The stone was not somewhere he
could show them. Not in its current state. Not with what it was
doing.</p>
<p>“That is not possible today,” he said, his voice strained.</p>
<p>“Why not?” I pressed. “Is it busy? Is it… feeding?”</p>
<p>The word hung in the cigar-scented air. Ugly. Primitive.</p>
<p>Visser looked from one man to the next. He saw the doubt hardening
into decision. His authority, that invisible currency, was bleeding
away. He turned his fury on me, pure and undiluted.</p>
<p>“You,” he hissed. “You think you have won something? You have won
nothing. You are a dead woman walking. You always have been. From the
moment you pulled that stone from the mud, you were a spent match. A
used rag.”</p>
<p>He took a step toward me. The men in their chairs did not move.
Rafael watched, impassive.</p>
<p>“You want to see the machine?” Visser’s voice dropped to a venomous
whisper. “You want to understand what it can do? Fine. Come to the
Amstel site. Tonight. Midnight. Come and see the future. Come and see
what happens to variables that have outlived their usefulness.”</p>
<p>It was an invitation to an execution. Everyone in the room knew
it.</p>
<p>But it was also a capitulation. He was abandoning the field of polite
lies. He was moving the battle to ground of his choosing, where the
rules were written in violence.</p>
<p>He straightened, regaining his composure like a man adjusting a cuff.
He nodded to the others, a stiff, formal gesture. “Gentlemen. I
apologize for this spectacle. The matter will be settled. Cleanly. You
have my word.”</p>
<p>He did not look at me again. He walked to the door, opened it, and
was gone. His footsteps faded down the hall.</p>
<p>The silence he left behind was thick and charged. De Wit cleared his
throat. Van Dijk stared into the fire. Scholten began to make a note in
a small book, his pen scratching loudly.</p>
<p>Rafael moved from the window. “Gentlemen. I believe the audience is
concluded.”</p>
<p>They rose, one by one, gathering their coats and hats. They filed out
without a word to me. I had been the catalyst for a reaction, and now I
was the residue left behind. The door closed, leaving me alone with
Rafael.</p>
<p>He finally looked at me. His face was tired. “You got what you
wanted. Their doubt. His rage.”</p>
<p>“It’s a trap,” I said.</p>
<p>“Of course it is.”</p>
<p>“You won’t interfere.”</p>
<p>“I cannot. Not directly. He has challenged you. You have accepted.
The city’s… equilibrium… now depends on the outcome.” He picked up
Visser’s abandoned brandy glass, looked at it, set it down. “He will
have the stone there. And the machine. It will be fully realized. He
will use it to demonstrate his power. And to eliminate you.”</p>
<p>“So I shouldn’t go.”</p>
<p>He gave me a thin, humorless smile. “If you do not go, you are
admitting your accusations are lies. He will be vindicated. The
investors will return to him. And he will have you killed anyway, at his
leisure. You have forced the crisis, Els. Now you must see it
through.”</p>
<p>I knew he was right. The tightrope was gone. There was only the
pit.</p>
<p>“What is the machine?” I asked. “What has he built?”</p>
<p>Rafael’s gaze grew distant. “I have only heard whispers. From men who
drank too much and woke up afraid of what they’d said. It is not a loom.
Not anymore. It is a heart. He is building a mechanical heart for his
new mill, and the stone is its chamber. It does not just draw power from
a single life. It resonates. It pulls from… proximity. From attention.
From the collective will of those around it. A factory full of workers,
focused on their tasks, their worries, their small lives… it would feed
on that. A slow, perpetual harvest. He calls it the <em>Eendracht</em>.
The Concord. Harmony.” He looked at me. “A harmony where every soul is a
note, and he is the only one who hears the music.”</p>
<p>The horror of it was so vast it felt cold. It wasn’t murder. It was
farming.</p>
<p>“And tonight?”</p>
<p>“Tonight, he will have a test subject. Someone with a strong will. A
defiant spirit. To prime it. To ignite the process.” He didn’t need to
say who that subject would be. “If it works… the proof of concept will
be undeniable. The men who were here today will fund him. They will not
care about the source of the power. They will only care that it is
theirs.”</p>
<p>I walked to the fireplace, holding my hands out to the flames. They
were steady. The hollow stillness inside me had filled with a clear,
cold substance. Like the <em>jenever</em> Jan served. Potent.
Inflammable.</p>
<p>“I have to break it,” I said.</p>
<p>“You have to try.”</p>
<p>I turned to face him. “You ‘find you do not care for the equation.’
But you won’t lift a finger to stop it.”</p>
<p>“I am lifting you,” he said simply. “It is all I can do. The city is
a machine, too, Els. More complex than his. I work within its gears. To
reach in and grab his would tear the whole mechanism apart. There would
be chaos. Fires in the street. The kind of mess that gets everyone
killed.” He stepped closer, his voice dropping. “But a single,
determined variable, introduced at the precise point of failure… that
can jam a single machine. Without collapsing the whole.”</p>
<p>It was a cold calculus. My life for a chance to stop his. A fair
trade, in the economy of power.</p>
<p>I nodded. I understood the game now. I had never left the water. I
was just in deeper, the pressure crushing, the light gone. All that was
left was to swim toward the only thing I could feel: the cold, blue
pulse of the stone, and the darker shadow of the man who wielded it.</p>
<p>“I’ll need a weapon,” I said.</p>
<p>Rafael reached into his coat and placed a small, heavy object on the
table beside the brandy glass. It was a diver’s knife. A good one. The
blade was short, thick, and cruelly sharp. The handle was worn smooth
from use.</p>
<p>“It was Pieter’s,” he said. “He was a sentimental man. He kept it
after he left the docks. For luck.”</p>
<p>I picked it up. The handle fit my palm as if it had been waiting
there. It had no luck in it. Only purpose.</p>
<p>“Midnight,” I said.</p>
<p>“The Amstel site. The main foundation pit.” He moved to the door.
“Good luck, Els. The city will not thank you. But I will remember the
equation.”</p>
<p>Then he was gone, and I was alone with the dying fire, the ghost of
cigar smoke, and the weight of the knife in my hand. The journal was
still on the chair. I left it there. Its words had done their work. Now
it was down to the language of blood, and steel, and a stone that drank
the light from the world.</p>
<p>I looked out the window. The day was bright and cold. The city
gleamed, a beautiful, heartless machine. I had until midnight to walk
through its gears one last time, to the place where its new, hungry
heart was waiting to beat.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-23-1"><strong>Chapter 23</strong></h2>
<p>The day was a lie. The cold, bright sun that glinted off the canal
belts and made the gabled facades look like polished bone was a
stage-light. It illuminated a city playing itself, a beautiful,
intricate deception. I walked through it, a ghost in the machinery. The
weight of Pieter’s knife was a secret gravity in the deep pocket of my
coat, pulling me down through the cheerful bustle of the Leidsestraat,
past the flower stalls with their defiant winter blooms, into the
narrower, quieter streets that led toward the river.</p>
<p>I was a variable. A single, determined variable. Rafael’s cold
calculus echoed in the rhythm of my steps. I understood the terms. My
life was the coefficient. The outcome was the jam in Van der Meer’s
machine. A fair trade. But fairness was a ledger for men who balanced
books, not for women who balanced on the knife-edge between the gutter
and the grave. I had walked that edge so long the drop was a familiar
companion. Tonight, I would either fall or I would learn to fly on the
thermals of the explosion.</p>
<p>My feet carried me without conscious direction. Not toward the Amstel
site, not yet. The hours until midnight were a vast, empty plain I had
to cross. I found myself on the Keizersgracht, stopping before a tall,
narrow house with green shutters. My sister’s house. The curtains were
drawn in the front parlor. A pram stood by the door, empty. A life
contained within clean walls, defined by the cries of a child and the
expectations of a husband. A life that had once been mine to grasp, if I
had been willing to soften my edges, to smile at the right men, to trade
my suspicion for security.</p>
<p>I had chosen the damp wool and the smell of fryer grease. I had
chosen the calculating glances in <em>De Visser</em>, the currency of
subtle teeth. I had chosen the deep, dark water. Looking at that pram, I
felt no regret, only a colder, clearer certainty. Her world, with its
rules written in invitations and gossip, was a machine, too. Just a
quieter one. Its gears were made of suggestion and exclusion, and it
crushed souls just as efficiently, it just left less visible blood. At
least in my world, the threats were honest. A knife was a knife. A man’s
greed was a naked, ugly thing. You could see it coming.</p>
<p>A shadow moved behind the glass of the door. I turned and walked away
before it could resolve into my sister’s face, before I could see the
pity or the fear or the quiet disapproval that was her own kind of
weapon. I had no place there. I was a toxin in that clean system.</p>
<p>The afternoon bled away in a series of aimless circuits. I bought a
bitter coffee from a stall and drank it standing against a wall,
watching the city move. The men in their dark coats and tall hats,
talking of shipments and shares. The women with their baskets and their
guarded eyes. The whole dance was a complex pressure system, and I was a
sudden, low pocket, a silence in the hum. I saw a young maid, barely
more than a girl, being berated by a shopkeeper for a chipped jug. Her
face was a mask of terrified submission, but her hands, clenched white
at her sides, told a different story. A story of a variable waiting for
its moment. I gave her a single, slow nod as I passed. Her eyes flicked
to mine, wide with surprise, then dropped again. But her shoulders
straightened, just a fraction. A seed. Planted in barren soil, perhaps.
But planted.</p>
<p>As dusk began to stain the sky the color of a fresh bruise, I knew
where I had to go. Not to prepare, but to remember. To anchor myself in
the deep, dark water from which I’d come.</p>
<p>The docks were the city’s exposed sinew. Here, the machine wasn’t
hidden behind lace curtains and polite conversation. It roared. It stank
of tar and rotting fish and the sour sweat of labor. The cranes were
frozen black skeletons against the purple sky. The water in the basins
was thick, sluggish, oil-slicked. This was the engine room. And I had
been a cog here once. A small, silent one, but a part of the grind.</p>
<p>I walked to the end of the Westelijke Eilanden pier, where the wind
came sharp and unfettered off the IJ. The cold needled through my coat,
the same precise, hateful cold as the rain on the night this began. I
stood where my father had often stood, looking out at the endless, flat
grey where the water met the cloud. He’d come here to think, he said. To
feel the size of the world beyond the canals.</p>
<p>I took the knife from my pocket. Pieter’s knife. I pulled the blade
from its leather sheath. The metal was dull in the twilight, but the
edge, when I tested it with my thumb, was a line of pure, potential
violence. A sentimental man, Rafael had said. He kept it for luck.</p>
<p>But sentiment was a luxury for the safe. For men who could afford to
keep trophies of a past life. For my father, for Pieter, a knife was a
tool. It cut rope, pried open crates, cleaned fish. It was an extension
of the hand, for work. For a woman alone, walking into a foundation pit
to face a man with a stone that drank light, a knife was not a tool. It
was a last, desperate argument. It was the final, sharp punctuation to a
life of questions.</p>
<p>A voice, rough with phlegm and cheap gin, slithered out of the
shadows of a stacked pallet. “That’s a pretty piece. A bit big for the
likes of you, isn’t it, <em>meisje</em>?”</p>
<p>I didn’t turn. I kept looking at the water, my fingers tightening on
the handle. I knew the type. The docks had its own ecosystem of
predators, the ones who couldn’t even hack it as stevedores, who fed on
the weaker strays. I was a woman alone. I was a provocation.</p>
<p>“I said,” the voice came closer, boots scraping on the wet stone.
“That’s a pretty piece. Why don’t you let me have a look?”</p>
<p>I could smell him now. Gin, unwashed wool, the sweet-rot smell of a
bad tooth. The calculus was immediate. A fight here, now, was noise. It
was attention. It was a variable introduced too early, in the wrong
equation. It could spoil everything.</p>
<p>He was close enough that I could hear his breathing. “Cat got your
tongue? Or are you just stupid?”</p>
<p>This was the other language. The one they understood. I had shown my
teeth in <em>De Visser</em> and made them look away. This one required a
sharper demonstration.</p>
<p>In one motion, I pivoted. Not away, but into him. I let the momentum
carry my arm, the knife a dark blur. I didn’t aim for his body. I aimed
for the space he occupied, for his threat. The blade stopped a hair’s
breadth from the hollow of his throat. I had stepped inside his guard,
my body close to his, the knife hand rock-steady. My other hand was a
fist in the greasy wool of his coat.</p>
<p>His eyes were wide, the whites gleaming in the gloom. The gin-sour
breath hitched in his chest.</p>
<p>“No,” I said, my voice lower than the wind. “It is not too big for
me. And you are in my light.”</p>
<p>I held the pose, letting him feel the certainty in my grip, the
absolute lack of tremor. Letting him understand that this was not a
bluff, that I was not a <em>meisje</em>, not a stray cat. I was a woman
with a diver’s knife and nothing left to lose. The gender of the thing
meant nothing. The power did. And for this frozen moment, the power was
a cold line against his throat.</p>
<p>He swallowed. A thick, wet sound. I saw the decision flicker in his
eyes: the bruised pride, the rising anger, and beneath it, the animal
fear of the sharp, hard thing pressing into his skin. Fear won. It
usually did.</p>
<p>I pushed him back, just enough to break contact. I didn’t step away.
I made him step back. One shuffling step, then another. He turned and
scuttled into the deeper shadows, a rat returning to its hole.</p>
<p>I sheathed the knife and put it back in my pocket. My heart was a
slow, heavy drum. No adrenaline, no fear. Just a cold confirmation. The
language worked. It was the only one that ever did.</p>
<p>I looked back at the water. The last of the light was gone. The city
behind me was a constellation of yellow windows, a map of a thousand
contained lives. Ahead was only the dark and the deep. My father had
taught me that in the water, panic was death. You had to accept the
pressure, the cold, the lack of light. You had to become a part of it.
Then you could move.</p>
<p>Van der Meer’s world was the same. A different kind of pressure, a
more subtle cold, a more deceptive darkness. But the principle held. I
had to stop fighting the fact of it. I had to accept that I was in it,
that it would crush me if it could. And then I had to move.</p>
<p>I left the pier and began the long walk to the Amstel. The streets
grew quieter, the respectable glow of the canal belts giving way to the
scattered, industrial glow of the developing south. The site was a scar
on the city’s edge. A vast, ordered chaos of mud, timber, and ambition.
During the day, it swarmed with men and machines. Now, under a moonless
sky, it was a tomb for giants. The silhouettes of cranes stood like
sentinels. Piles of brick and timber were dark mounds. The main
foundation pit, the heart of Van der Meer’s new palace of commerce, was
a gash of deeper blackness in the earth.</p>
<p>A high wooden fence surrounded it, but a section had been loosened, a
single plank pried back just enough for a slender variable to slip
through. Rafael’s work. I paused, listening. The wind moaned through the
girders. Somewhere, a loose sheet of tin clattered. No voices. No
guards. Van der Meer would not post guards. He would not share this
moment. This was his ritual, his private communion with power. He would
be alone. He believed himself secure within the gears of his own
machine.</p>
<p>I slipped through the gap.</p>
<p>The ground was churned mud, frozen into treacherous ruts. I moved
from shadow to shadow, from the hulk of a silent steam shovel to the lee
of a mortar mixer. The pit lay ahead. I approached its edge and looked
down.</p>
<p>It was a square hole, thirty feet to the bottom. The earth walls were
shored up with timber. At the center, the foundation stone had been laid
weeks ago—a massive block of granite. But before it, a smaller, simpler
stone had been placed. A pedestal. And on that pedestal, resting on a
cushion of black velvet even in the mud, was the <em>Zeevonk</em>.</p>
<p>It pulsed.</p>
<p>It was not a light, but an anti-light. A slow, rhythmic drawing-in of
the darkness around it. A blue so deep it was almost black, a heartbeat
of void. It made the night around it seem faint, insubstantial. Looking
at it was like looking at a hole in the world, a hole that led to a
cold, hungry depth where no light had ever been. The stone from the
deep. The heart of the machine.</p>
<p>And standing before it, his back to me, was Van der Meer.</p>
<p>He wore a formal black coat, as if for a board meeting. His hands
were clasped behind his back. He was utterly still, a man in prayer. The
eerie, draining pulse of the stone washed over him, making him a
silhouette cut from the fabric of the night itself.</p>
<p>This was it. The point of failure. The place where the variable had
to be introduced.</p>
<p>There was a ladder fixed to the side of the pit, leading down. I put
my hand on the cold wood. Then I stopped.</p>
<p>A whisper of sound. Not from the pit. From behind me.</p>
<p>I melted back against the timber shoring, pulling my coat close. Two
figures emerged from between piles of brick. Not workmen. Their
movements were too fluid, too quiet. They were dressed in dark,
close-fitting clothes. They carried no lanterns. They moved like they
knew the dark.</p>
<p>They went to the edge of the pit, not far from where I stood, and
looked down at their master and his prize. They did not speak. They
simply took up positions, one on either side of the ladder, facing
outwards. Guards. Not the uniformed kind. The other kind. The kind
Rafael had warned me about. The kind that worked in the shadows, that
cleaned up messes. Van der Meer was not a fool. He was a man who
calculated risk. He would not come alone. He had brought his own gears,
his own teeth.</p>
<p>The calculus changed. Drastically.</p>
<p>One man, I might have surprised. One man, with the cold ferocity of
nothing left to lose, I might have reached. Two professional killers,
watching the only entrance, changed the equation from difficult to
impossible. I was not a soldier. I was a woman with a knife and a death
wish. They were the embodiment of the machine’s immune system. They
would swat me aside before I was halfway down the ladder.</p>
<p>The seed of true resolution, planted in the darkness of this
all-is-lost moment, began to stir. It was not a plan. It was a memory.
The maid’s clenched hands. The dock rat’s fearful retreat. The language
of power was not always direct force. Sometimes it was leverage.
Sometimes it was understanding the pressure points of a different
machine.</p>
<p>Van der Meer’s machine was powered by greed, by control. But it was
populated by people. And people had other pressures. Other loyalties.
Other fears.</p>
<p>I looked at the two guards. They were part of his system, but they
were not him. They were tools. And tools could be turned, if you found
the right weakness, if you applied pressure to the right point.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, shutting out the pulse of the stone, and thought.
Rafael’s words. <em>The city is a machine, too. More complex than
his.</em> I had been trying to jam Van der Meer’s machine directly. A
frontal assault. But Rafael worked within the city’s gears. He used its
complexity.</p>
<p>I could not fight these men. But the city could.</p>
<p>I slipped away from the pit’s edge, back into the maze of
construction. I moved quickly now, with purpose. I emerged from the site
at a different point, circling around to the nearest proper street. It
was deserted, lined with darkened workshops. But a few blocks away, I
knew there was a <em>politiebureau</em>. A small, sleepy outpost for a
district that was mostly mud and ambition.</p>
<p>I did not run toward it. I walked. But my walk was the walk of the
docks, of <em>De Visser</em>. The walk of a woman who was not a victim.
I pushed open the door to the station house.</p>
<p>The air inside was warm and stale, smelling of coal smoke, cheap
paper, and old sweat. A single, weary officer in a rumpled uniform sat
behind a high desk, writing in a ledger by the light of an oil lamp. He
looked up, his expression shifting from boredom to mild annoyance at the
interruption.</p>
<p>“<em>Ja?</em> What is it?”</p>
<p>I did not approach as a supplicant. I stood just inside the door,
letting the cold air from outside swirl around me. I met his eyes and
held them. I spoke in the flat, uninflected tone of someone reporting a
fact, not asking for help.</p>
<p>“There is a theft in progress at the Van der Meer construction site
on the Amstel. The new foundation. Men with tools. They are breaking
into the site office.”</p>
<p>The officer’s eyebrows lifted. “Van der Meer’s site? And who are
you?”</p>
<p>“A night-watchman’s daughter. He is sick. I walk his round.” The lie
came easily, dressed in the plain cloth of truth. “I saw them. Three
men. They had crowbars.”</p>
<p>I leaned forward slightly, just enough to let the lamplight catch the
earnest fear I forced into my eyes. The other language. “The
<em>heer</em> Van der Meer… he is a strict man. If there is theft and my
father is not there… it will be his position. Please. If you come
quickly, perhaps you can catch them.”</p>
<p>I invoked the two pressures the city’s machine understood: property
and patronage. The threat to a rich man’s property, and the potential
downfall of a poor man to a rich man’s wrath. It was a story this
officer could process. A woman reporting a crime was suspect. A daughter
trying to save her father’s job was sympathetic. A chance to be seen
doing his duty for a powerful man was opportunity.</p>
<p>He hesitated for only a second, weighing the chill of the night
against the potential benefits. Duty, and a chance to curry favor, won.
He heaved himself to his feet, grabbing his hat and a heavy wooden baton
from a hook.</p>
<p>“Show me.”</p>
<p>“They were at the east fence, by the office shed,” I said, pointing
back the way I came. “I… I dare not go closer. My father would kill
me.”</p>
<p>He grunted, a sound of masculine understanding. “Wait here.”</p>
<p>He strode out into the night, his boots ringing on the cobbles. I did
not wait. The moment the door swung shut, I was moving again, a shadow
retracing my steps, but on a different vector.</p>
<p>By the time the officer’s shouted “<em>Halt! Politie!</em>” echoed
across the silent site, I was back at the edge of the foundation pit.
The scene below had changed.</p>
<p>Van der Meer had turned from the stone. He was looking up, his face a
pale mask of fury in the negative light. His two guards were no longer
at the ladder. They were gone, lured away by the disturbance at the far
end of the site—the sound of their master’s property being threatened,
the blundering intrusion of the city’s own clumsy gear.</p>
<p>It was the only window I would get.</p>
<p>I did not use the ladder. I sat on the edge of the pit, turned, and
dropped, my feet finding the rough timber shoring, my hands scraping
down the cold earth as I half-slid, half-fell the thirty feet to the
bottom. I landed in a crouch, the impact jarring my knees, mud soaking
instantly through my clothes.</p>
<p>Van der Meer stared. For a second, pure, uncomprehending astonishment
wiped the fury from his face. He saw a mud-smeared woman rising from the
ground of his sacred pit. I was an impossibility in his calculus.</p>
<p>“You,” he breathed. The word was not fear. It was disgust. The
disgust of a master clockmaker finding a slug in his gear train.</p>
<p>I pulled Pieter’s knife from my pocket. The leather sheath fell to
the mud. The blade, freed, seemed to drink the faint, stolen light from
the stone.</p>
<p>“The variable,” I said.</p>
<p>His astonishment hardened into contempt. He didn’t call for his
guards. He didn’t move. He simply stood between me and the pulsing
<em>Zeevonk</em>, as if his presence alone were a barrier I could not
cross.</p>
<p>“Els de Vries,” he said, his voice regaining its smooth, oiled
control. “The diver’s daughter. The little rat from the docks. Rafael’s
errand girl. I should have had you smothered in your cradle.” He took a
step forward, not away from me, but toward me. “Do you think that toy
makes you a threat? You are a flaw. A speck of grit. And I am the
millstone.”</p>
<p>He was not a physical man. He was soft where my father had been hard,
pale where Pieter had been weathered. But his power was not in his body.
It was in his certainty. He believed, utterly, in the hierarchy of the
world. He was at the top. I was at the bottom. The knife in my hand was
a violation of natural law.</p>
<p>“You took my father,” I said, beginning to circle, forcing him to
turn, to keep the stone in my sight. “You took Pieter. You are taking
the soul of this city, piece by piece, to feed that thing.”</p>
<p>“I am <em>giving</em> this city a soul!” he snapped, the control
cracking for an instant, revealing the fanatic beneath. “A new heart!
One that beats with order, with power, with purpose! Not the weak,
sentimental flutter of the past. Your father was a relic. Pieter was a
fool who thought he could bargain with the deep. They were consumed by
the old world. I am building the new one. And you…” He smiled, a thin,
cruel stretch of the lips. “You are just a sacrifice it requires. The
final piece. The unexpected variable that perfects the equation. The
deep demands a price, girl. It always has. Why do you think the sea
takes men? It is a transaction.”</p>
<p>He lunged then. Not at me, but to the side, toward the pedestal. His
hand closed around the <em>Zeevonk</em>.</p>
<p>The effect was instantaneous.</p>
<p>The slow, sucking pulse became a violent surge. The blue-black
void-light erupted, not outwards, but inwards, into him. It raced up his
arm, veins of anti-light branching under his skin. His back arched. A
sound tore from his throat that was not human—a grating, resonant
shriek, like stone grinding on stone. The air turned brittle and cold.
The mud at our feet began to frost over.</p>
<p>He was not controlling the stone. He was merging with it. The machine
and its maker becoming one.</p>
<p>His eyes opened. They were no longer his eyes. They were pools of the
same hungry void, the same deep blue-black. He turned them on me, and I
felt it—a pulling, a draining. Not of light, but of will. Of heat. Of
life. It was the feeling of the deep pressure, magnified a thousand
times, focused into a gaze.</p>
<p>“See,” the thing that was Van der Meer said, its voice a chorus of
whispers from a cold abyss. “See the heart of the new world.”</p>
<p>My limbs felt heavy. The knife in my hand seemed like a absurd twig.
The cold was inside me, in my bones, in my blood. This was the true
machine. Not gears of iron, but gears of stolen essence, of consumed
lives. And I was next in line.</p>
<p>But the seed, planted in the darkest moment, broke through.</p>
<p><em>A single, determined variable, introduced at the precise point of
failure…</em></p>
<p>The point of failure was not Van der Meer. It was the transaction.
The price. The deep demanded a sacrifice. He had offered my father,
Pieter, the city itself. But the deep, like the city, was a machine. And
it could be jammed.</p>
<p>I did not fight the cold. I did not try to strike at him. I accepted
the pressure, the crushing, soul-sucking void. I stopped being a woman
trying to kill a man. I became the variable.</p>
<p>I threw the knife.</p>
<p>Not at Van der Meer. At the stone.</p>
<p>Pieter’s knife. The diver’s tool. The sentimental man’s luck. It was
not steel aimed at a heart. It was a symbol aimed at a transaction.</p>
<p>The blade tumbled, a flash of dull metal in the negation of light. It
struck the <em>Zeevonk</em> not with a clang, but with a sound like a
bell cracking under ice.</p>
<p>And it stuck.</p>
<p>The pulsing stopped. The inward surge of void-light froze. The chorus
of whispers became a single, sharp, silent scream of wrongness.</p>
<p>Van der Meer stared at the knife hilt protruding from the heart of
his power. The void-light in his eyes flickered, confused. The
transaction was corrupted. The sacrifice was tainted. A tool, a memory,
a piece of the sentimental, human world he despised, was lodged in the
heart of his perfect machine.</p>
<p>“No…” he whispered, his own voice returning, ragged with pain and
disbelief. “No, it… it is not… the equation…”</p>
<p>He staggered, clutching his chest as if the knife were in him. The
connection was breaking. The stone began to vibrate, a high, painful
whine that shivered in the teeth. Cracks, lines of real, ordinary black,
spiderwebbed across its blue-black surface.</p>
<p>The machine was jamming.</p>
<p>He turned his desperate, human eyes to me. The hatred in them was
pure, undiluted, the last fuel in a dying engine. “You ruin…
everything…”</p>
<p>From above, shouts. The clatter of boots on the ladder. His guards,
returning. The police officer, confused and shouting. The city’s gears,
intruding.</p>
<p>Van der Meer made a last, desperate grab for the stone, for the
knife, to pull it free, to reset the equation.</p>
<p>I didn’t stop him. I just watched as his fingers closed around the
hilt of Pieter’s knife.</p>
<p>The <em>Zeevonk</em> shattered.</p>
<p>It did not explode. It imploded. There was a sound like a vast intake
of breath, and then a silent, concussive wave of force that had no
light, no heat, only a profound, nullifying <em>absence</em>. It blew
outwards from the pedestal.</p>
<p>It hit Van der Meer first. He simply… unraveled. His form smeared,
like ink in water, and was sucked into the collapsing point where the
stone had been. There was no scream. Just a final, vanishing sigh.</p>
<p>The wave hit me.</p>
<p>It was not pain. It was the total negation of feeling. Of thought. Of
self. For an eternity that lasted less than a second, I did not exist. I
was the variable consumed by the failed equation.</p>
<p>Then the world rushed back in. Sound: shouts, screams, the groan of
timber. Sensation: the frozen mud against my cheek, the taste of dirt
and iron in my mouth. I was lying on my side, ten feet from where I had
stood. The pedestal was empty. Of the stone, of the knife, of Van der
Meer, there was no sign. Only a shallow, perfectly smooth depression in
the earth, as if something had been neatly, surgically, erased.</p>
<p>Boots splashed through mud. Rough hands grabbed my shoulders, rolled
me over. I looked up into the face of one of Van der Meer’s guards. His
professional calm was gone. His face was a rictus of terror and fury.
Behind him, the other guard held the bewildered police officer at bay, a
knife to his throat.</p>
<p>The guard who held me shook me, his fingers digging into my
collarbone. “What did you do? <em>What did you do?</em>”</p>
<p>I looked past him, up at the rim of the pit. Other figures were
gathering, silhouetted against the night sky—workmen roused by the
noise, more police. The city’s machine was waking up to the chaos in one
of its newest gears.</p>
<p>I looked back at the guard. I smiled. It was a show of teeth, bloody
and cold.</p>
<p>“I jammed the machine,” I whispered.</p>
<p>His fist drew back. I saw it coming. I didn’t try to move. The
darkness after the wave was still in me, a comforting blanket. Let it
end here. Let the final, crushing gear do its work.</p>
<p>But the blow never landed.</p>
<p>A new voice, sharp with authority, cut through the din. “Release her.
Now.”</p>
<p>The guard froze. He looked up.</p>
<p>Standing at the top of the pit, flanked by four men in dark coats who
were not police, was Rafael. He held no weapon. He needed none. His
presence was a different kind of pressure. He looked down, his face
impassive, taking in the scene: the empty depression, the missing stone,
the missing magnate, the mud-smeared woman in the grip of a thug.</p>
<p>“This is a city matter now,” Rafael said, his voice carrying the
weight of the hidden gears. “Release her to me.”</p>
<p>The guard’s eyes darted from Rafael to his partner, to the growing
crowd. The calculus changed again. Their master was gone. Their purpose
was void. The city’s official machine, and its hidden counterpart, were
converging. To fight was to be ground to paste between them.</p>
<p>He let me go, shoving me back into the mud. He and his partner melted
into the shadows of the pit, disappearing into the construction maze
like the rats they were. The police officer stumbled free, clutching his
throat, babbling about thieves and ghosts.</p>
<p>Rafael’s men descended the ladder. They did not help me up. They
formed a cordon around me. Rafael climbed down last, picking his way
fastidiously through the mud. He stopped before the smooth, empty
depression. He looked at it for a long moment. Then he looked at me.</p>
<p>“The stone?” he asked, quietly.</p>
<p>“Gone.”</p>
<p>“Van der Meer?”</p>
<p>“Gone with it.”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. The equation had been solved. Not as he’d planned.
The variable had not been eliminated; it had corrupted the entire
formula. “And the knife?”</p>
<p>“Gone too.”</p>
<p>A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. “Pieter would
have appreciated the irony.” He stepped closer, his voice dropping so
only I could hear. “You understand, this changes nothing. The
machine—the city’s machine—must still turn. There will be an inquiry. A
story. A wealthy man disappears at his construction site. A strange
woman found at the scene. The gears will demand a narrative.”</p>
<p>I pushed myself to my knees. The cold was settling into my bones, the
deep, permanent cold of the void. “What narrative?”</p>
<p>He looked at me, and in his eyes I saw the final, cold truth of his
world. “That depends on you, Els. You can be the tragic victim. The
madwoman. The thief. Or…” He paused. “You can be a variable that is
absorbed. A useful piece in a new configuration. The woman who witnessed
a tragedy, who helped bring clarity. The choice is yours. But you must
choose now. Before the larger gears engage.”</p>
<p>He was offering me a place within the machine. Not as a victim, not
as grit to be ground away, but as a cog. A small, silent one, perhaps.
But a part of the grind. It was the only survival his world
permitted.</p>
<p>Above us, the official voices grew louder. Lanterns bobbed. The city
was here, in all its clumsy, hungry majesty.</p>
<p>I looked at the empty space where the heart of a new world had almost
beaten. I looked at my muddy, empty hands. I had swum toward the cold,
blue pulse, and I had found only a deeper dark. I had jammed the
machine. But the city’s machine, the old, complex, heartless one, was
still here. It would always be here.</p>
<p>I met Rafael’s gaze. I had no teeth left to show. Only a bottomless
cold, and a single, final question.</p>
<p>“What,” I asked, my voice raw with the chill of the deep, “do you
need me to say?”</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-24">Chapter 24</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-24-1"><strong>Chapter 24</strong></h2>
<p>The rain was a soft, persistent murmur on the cobbles, a gentle
afterthought to the storm that had broken the world. It soaked into the
shoulders of my new coat—thick, grey wool, government-issue—with a
patient indifference. It did not needle. It simply was. I walked, my
footsteps a measured, official sound against the wet stone, the echo
contained by the high, gabled facades of the Herengracht.</p>
<p>The warmth inside the <em>Binnenhof</em> committee room was a
controlled, dry heat, smelling of polished wood, ink, and the faint,
waxy scent of power. The low murmur of men in dark suits hit a lull as I
entered. Not many women came in here alone, not at this hour, not
dressed like this: a clean, pressed cog in the state’s machine. I met
the glances of the committee members, held them for the exact,
prescribed beat—respectful, but not challenging—until they returned to
their papers. A show of compliance was the only currency they understood
in here.</p>
<p>“Mevrouw Visser.” The chairman, a man with a face like a folded
ledger, nodded from the high bench. He did not smile. He gestured to the
solitary chair placed in the pool of light from the green-shaded lamp.
Testimony expected now, in precise words and in a specific order. Always
order, in this case.</p>
<p>I took the seat, my fingers resting on the cool, varnished wood of
the table before me. They were clean. The nails were short, unbroken.
There was no grit under them.</p>
<p>“For the final time, for the official record,” the chairman intoned,
his voice dust-dry. “Describe the events of the night of the
twenty-third, at the Van der Meer construction site.”</p>
<p>I drew a breath. The air here had no fryer grease, no brine. It had
no taste at all.</p>
<p>“I was conducting a follow-up inquiry,” I began, the words smooth and
familiar from repetition, “into the disappearance of my client, Meneer
Pieter van der Linden, as previously detailed in my earlier statements.
My contract, as entered into evidence, permitted such activity. I had
reason to believe Meneer van der Meer might have information.”</p>
<p>The story unspooled from me, a clean, efficient thread. A concerned
brother. A corrupt developer. A deal gone wrong. A tragic confrontation.
I was a witness. A professional doing a job, caught in a dangerous
situation between two ruthless men. I had seen van der Meer, agitated,
holding a strange artifact—a geological oddity, perhaps, from his
dredging work. In the struggle with van der Meer’s man, Rafael—a known
fixer with a history of violence—the artifact was lost to the waters.
Van der Meer, in his panic, had fallen. A terrible accident. A
tragedy.</p>
<p>I had tried to help. I had called the authorities.</p>
<p>The words were a kind of masonry, building a plausible, sturdy wall
behind which the truth could lie buried, a cold, blue pulse extinguished
in the deep silt. I was the bricklayer. My payment was my continued
existence within the walled city.</p>
<p>“And your relationship with the individual known as Rafael?” another
committee member asked, his eyes sharp behind his spectacles.</p>
<p>“Professional. Antagonistic. He was an agent of Meneer van der Meer.
He attempted to impede my investigation. He is currently assisting with
inquiries elsewhere.” My voice was flat. Neutral. Rafael was in another
room, in another building, likely giving a different but complementary
version of this calibrated truth. We were gears now, meshing silently to
turn the larger mechanism. He had his place. I had mine. The machine
demanded synergy, not conflict.</p>
<p>The chairman made a note. “And the artifact? This… ‘stone’?”</p>
<p>“As I said. Lost. It seemed to be a point of obsession for Meneer van
der Meer. Of no material value, I should think. Just a rock.”</p>
<p>They nodded. A rock was a good thing to lose. It asked no questions,
demanded no audits.</p>
<p>The inquiry lasted another hour. They picked at the edges of my
narrative, not to tear it, but to seam it more neatly into the official
tapestry. The story was needed. The city’s gears—the press, the courts,
the civic record—demanded a narrative. The wealthy, overreaching
developer, killed by his own ambition. The brave, if unfortunate,
brother lost earlier to the man’s ruthlessness. A tidy circle. A closed
case.</p>
<p>I was the useful variable that had been absorbed. The woman who had
witnessed, who had helped bring clarity. Not a victim. Not a madwoman. A
functionary of resolution.</p>
<p>When they dismissed me, it was with a curt thanks. My coat was
waiting on the stand. I put it on, feeling the weight of the good wool,
the broad cut that hid the shape beneath. I walked out into the central
courtyard of the Binnenhof. The rain had softened to a mist, blurring
the sharp Gothic lines of the Hall of Knights into something mournful
and distant.</p>
<p>A figure detached itself from the shadow of a pillar. Rafael. He fell
into step beside me, our footsteps matching on the wet flagstones. He
wore a dark, well-tailored suit. He looked like a senior clerk. A
trusted one.</p>
<p>“It is done,” he said, not looking at me.</p>
<p>“It is done.”</p>
<p>“Your statement was satisfactory.”</p>
<p>“As was yours, I assume.”</p>
<p>A faint, almost imperceptible nod. The irony was not lost on either
of us. We had tried to destroy each other. Now our survival was mutually
assured by the lie we told in unison. The ultimate transaction.</p>
<p>“They have offered you a position,” he said as we passed under the
archway, out toward the street. “The new municipal liaison office.
Investigating certain… delicate matters. Matters where a woman’s
perspective might be useful for public perception.”</p>
<p>I had known the offer was coming. It had been implied in the
chairman’s final, assessing look. The machine always found a use for a
tool that had proven durable.</p>
<p>“And you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“A similar role. Different department. We will not need to see each
other often.”</p>
<p>That was a relief, written in the cold air between us. We stopped at
the canal’s edge. The water was grey, opaque, holding its secrets
close.</p>
<p>“He would have hated this,” Rafael said quietly. “Van der Meer. All
that power, that vision… reduced to a clerical error. A footnote in a
committee report.”</p>
<p>“He wanted a new world,” I said. “The old one just digested him.”</p>
<p>Rafael turned to look at me then, and I saw the man who had pointed a
knife at my heart, who had bargained with monsters. But the fervor was
gone. The knife was gone. In his eyes was only the flat, efficient sheen
of a man who balances ledgers that deal in lives. “There is no new
world, Els. There is only the machine. You can be outside it, and be
crushed. Or you can be inside it, and turn. Those are the only
coordinates.”</p>
<p>He touched the brim of his hat—a polite, meaningless gesture—and
walked away, his form dissolving into the mist and the bureaucrats
streaming out for their midday meal.</p>
<p>I stood alone. I had my life. I had a job that would pay in coin, not
in kind. I had a story that would hold. I had been pulled from the void
and slotted neatly into the great, grinding clockwork of the city. I was
safe. I was warm. I was clean.</p>
<p>The cold I felt then had nothing to do with the weather. It was the
cold of the deep, the abyssal chill I had chosen to swim away from. I
had jammed the machine of a mad god, only to become a lubricated part of
the older, subtler, more patient one. I had shown my teeth so many
times, only to learn that in this place, the real power lay in having no
teeth at all. In having a smooth, blank face that asked no questions
that mattered, that told only the stories it was fed.</p>
<p>I began to walk, not toward the new municipal offices, but away from
them, my feet carrying me without conscious direction. The grand canals
gave way to narrower waterways, the fine houses to workshops and
warehouses. The smell of the city changed—less wax and polish, more damp
brick, rust, and the distant, familiar tang of the sea.</p>
<p>I found myself on a familiar bridge. The rain had stopped. Below, the
water of the <em>Oudezijds</em> was the color of tarnished lead. I
looked down at my reflection in the murky surface: a woman in a grey
coat, her face pale and indistinct. A respectable ghost.</p>
<p>My hands, buried in the deep pockets, closed into fists. They were
empty. They were always empty now. But in my mind, I felt the
ghost-weight of the stone—not the god-thing, but the first one, the
river-smoothed piece of granite Pieter had given me a lifetime ago. A
paperweight. A reminder of a different kind of depth. I had thrown it
into the sea to save a man who was already dead. A futile, human
gesture.</p>
<p>From the pocket of the fine coat, my fingers retrieved not the stone,
but a single, worn guilden. My last coin from the old life. I turned it
over. The metal was warm from my skin.</p>
<p>I did not throw it in. I held it tight. A show of teeth was not
currency here. But perhaps a single, stubborn coin of one’s own could
be. Not to buy anything. Just to prove you still had something that
wasn’t issued to you.</p>
<p>I walked off the bridge. The streets grew tighter, darker, smelling
of life lived raw and close. I heard the clatter of a cart, the shout of
a fishmonger closing up, the wail of a child from an open window above.
The city’s true sound, beneath the murmur of committees.</p>
<p>And then I saw the sign, swinging gently in the damp breeze: <em>De
Visser</em>. The paint was more faded than I remembered. One of the
windows was cracked, patched with tape.</p>
<p>I stopped. The warmth from within would be a physical blow, thick
with the smell of stale beer and brine and hard work. The conversation
would be a low, guttural murmur. Heads would turn if I walked in. Not
many women came in here alone, not at this hour, not looking like I did:
a respectable ghost haunting the wrong neighborhood.</p>
<p>Jan would be behind the zinc counter. He would not smile. He would
see the coat, the clean hands, the empty, official look in my eyes. He
might nod. He might not. He would push a chipped tumbler of
<em>jenever</em> across the wood. Payment expected later.</p>
<p>In coin, or in kind.</p>
<p>I stood there for a long time, on the threshold of the rain-darkened
street and the yellow light pooling from the tavern window. The choice
was not the one Rafael had given me. That choice was already made. The
machine had me.</p>
<p>This was a different choice. A smaller one. A choice of rooms. Of
which kind of warmth to pretend could thaw the deep cold inside.</p>
<p>I could walk in. I could take the glass. I could let them see the
ghost, let them whisper. I could pay in the coin I had, and see what, if
anything, I got in kind.</p>
<p>Or I could turn, and walk back toward the wide, clean canals, to the
office with the dry heat and the taste of nothing, to the life that had
been given to me, where I would be a useful, silent cog, turning in the
dark, telling the stories I was fed until I forgot I had a voice of my
own.</p>
<p>The mist beaded on the wool of my government-issue coat. I looked at
my reflection in the tavern window—a blurred, grey shape against the
glow of human noise.</p>
<p>Slowly, I unbuttoned the coat. I took it off. I folded it over my
arm, hiding the institutional grey. Beneath, I wore a simple, dark
dress. It was my own.</p>
<p>I pushed open the door of <em>De Visser</em>.</p>
<p>The warmth was a physical blow. The smell hit me—stale beer, brine,
the tang of worked bodies—like a forgotten language. The low murmur
stumbled, then died. Heads turned. Eyes, hard and curious, appraised the
woman who walked in alone. They saw the dress, the face that was no
longer a girl’s, the eyes that had seen the bottom of things.</p>
<p>I met the glances. I held them. I did not look down. I did not
smile.</p>
<p>I walked to the zinc counter. Jan, older, greyer, but still built
like a barrel, looked up from a glass he was polishing. His eyes took me
in. They flickered over the folded coat on my arm. They saw the woman
beneath it. He gave no sign of recognition. No sign of welcome.</p>
<p>He placed the polished glass down. He reached for the bottle of
<em>jenever</em>. He poured two fingers into a chipped tumbler and
pushed it across the wood.</p>
<p>I laid the single, worn guilden on the counter between us. It was not
enough. It was never enough.</p>
<p>He looked at the coin. He looked at me. His gaze was flat, unreadable
as the canal water outside.</p>
<p>Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he pushed the coin back toward
me. He gave the faintest shake of his head. His eyes held mine, and in
their depths was an older, simpler understanding. Payment was expected
later.</p>
<p>In coin, or in kind.</p>
<p>I took the glass. My fingers closed around the chill of it. I did not
drink. I turned, leaning my back against the solid wood of the bar,
facing the room. I looked at the men hunched over their drinks, at the
shadows pooled in the corners, at the world that was real and rough and
unforgiving.</p>
<p>I had come back to the beginning. But I was not the same. The stray
cat was gone. In its place was something harder to define. A woman who
knew the price of the machine, and the cost of staying out of it. A
woman with a story she would never tell, and a cold inside her that no
warmth could touch.</p>
<p>But she was here. In her own dress. With a coin in her pocket that
was her own. And a glass in her hand, paid for on a promise.</p>
<p>The murmur of conversation started up again, lower now, weaving
around me. I was part of the scenery again. A fixture. I took a sip. The
<em>jenever</em> burned its familiar, cleansing path down my throat.</p>
<p>The door opened again, letting in a slice of damp, grey light. A man
entered, shaking water from his hat. He was young, his face drawn with a
worry too sharp for his years. He scanned the room, his eyes skipping
over the regulars, searching. They landed on me. They hesitated. A
woman, alone at the bar.</p>
<p>He approached. Not with the swagger of the regulars, but with the
tentative step of someone seeking something specific in the wrong
place.</p>
<p>“Mevrouw?” he said, his voice barely above the rumble of the room.
“They said… they said I might find someone here. Someone who asks
questions.”</p>
<p>I turned my head slowly. I looked at him. I said nothing. I just
waited, the glass cool in my hand.</p>
<p>He swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “It’s my sister. She’s gone.
The police, they say she’s just run off. But she wouldn’t. Not like
this.” He reached into his inner pocket, pulled out a folded,
much-handled piece of paper. A cheap lithograph. A girl’s face, smiling
stiffly. “They won’t listen. They have their story.”</p>
<p>I looked from the paper to his eyes. I saw the desperation there. The
refusal to be digested by the easy narrative. The grit in the
machine.</p>
<p>The cold inside me shifted. It did not thaw. It focused. It became a
point, a needle of ice.</p>
<p>I looked past him, to Jan behind the bar. He was watching, his
expression unchanged. I raised my glass a fraction of an inch. An
acknowledgment. A promise.</p>
<p>I turned back to the young man. I took the lithograph from his
trembling fingers. The paper was cheap. The girl’s smile was a lie. But
the question in her brother’s eyes was the truest thing I had seen all
day.</p>
<p>“Sit down,” I said, my voice rough with the <em>jenever</em> and the
long silence of official rooms. I nodded to the stool beside me. “Tell
me.”</p>
<p>He sat. The machine turned in its distant, well-oiled chambers. But
here, in the warm, smelling dark of <em>De Visser</em>, a different kind
of work was beginning. A smaller grind. A human one.</p>
<p>I took another sip, and listened.</p>
